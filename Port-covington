- 273.2 million would go to create a new street grid

- 68.8 million would go to site work, such as stormwater management, fencing and erosion control, and demolition of existing utilities

INTRO:
Sagamore Development Co., the real estate firm privately owned by Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, wants to redevelop more than 200 acres of mostly empty industrial land in South Baltimore, creating a ring of riverfront parks and building new apartments and condos, stores and offices, as well as manufacturing space and a new headquarters for Under Armour.

The firm is seeking $1.1 billion in support from local, state and federal governments for needed infrastructure. This includes $535 million in tax increment financing (TIF) from Baltimore City,  with funding coming from municipal bonds and repaid through new property taxes generated by the project.

Phase 2: East Waterfront. Phase 2 will focus on the property's eastern end with designs calling for a lively shopping and residential district. The plans for this phase allow 1,000 residences — nearly 900 of them studios or one-bedroom apartments — as well as more than 500,000 square feet of retail space, 300 hotel rooms, 45,000 square feet of so-called "maker space" and a 2,500-square-foot "civic" building, possibly a post office. A new water taxi stand, eastern waterfront park and 1.5-acre plaza, as well as 3,000 parking spaces are also planned.

Phase 3: HANOVER, CROMWELL, MCCOMAS, I-95 & LIGHT RAIL. Phase 3 would focus on Hanover and Cromwell streets, with room for more than 1,886 additional residences; more than 240,000 square feet of retail, 1.15 million square feet of office space; 46,500 square feet in maker space and 3,350 new parking spaces. The firm also expects changes to I-95, a Light Rail spur and the addition of about 4,000 square feet of civic space.

************

Phase 4: West End
Phase 4 would focus on building out a largely residential "West End," with 2,000 more residences, including a smattering of about 74 townhouses. The West End would also include about 800,000 square feet of offices, 130,000 square feet of retail; 54,000 square feet in retail space; and 95,000 square feet in manufacturing. This phase would also involve west shore park, 13,000 square feet of civic space, including a possible school, paddock and "cultural center" or music venue.

--> 47

************

Phase 5: West End and Founders Park
The final phase involves the relocation of The Baltimore Sun, which has a long-term lease with Sagamore for its printing plant. The Sun's plant would be replaced by more than 8,500 new residences; more than 300,000 square feet of retail; about 300,000 square feet of office space and 200,000 square feet of maker space and 7,900 parking spaces. Founders Park and 11,500 square feet in civic space, identified as a possible library, would also be built as part of this phase.

************


Sagamore won backing from a Baltimore city design panel in May, clearing the first hurdle in its plan. The developmnet will go before the planning commission and city council later this summer. If it moves forward, the request would be the largest tax-increment financing deal in Baltimore history and among the largest in the country.
