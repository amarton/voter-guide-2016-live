    "q1":"Early Childhood Education: Too many families in the First District leave once they have kids. I believe that Universal Pre-Kindergarten would be a powerful inducement to keep families in the city. Economist James Heckman has shown that every dollar spent on early childhood education yields six dollars in reducing incarceration and welfare dependency. Early childhood education helps close the academic achievement gap and can keep middle class families in the city.</p><p>Fiscal accountability: I run a non profit. Every year I get audited. If I misspend any money my organization gets shut down. Why is it that our city is operating with no regular audits? Having been a teacher, I am deeply concerned that money gets lost at North Ave, and in </p><p>Community policing: we need to see our officers out of their cars engaging with our community. We need to shift recruitment practices and reach out to more Baltimore City residents to become officers. We need to enhance training to include best practices around cultural competence and implicit bias. We need to shift the metric of success away from arrests made, to citizen satisfaction. </p><p>Finally, I would like to see a more walkable and bikable First District. We should develop in a way that puts pedestrians first. We should follow the Baltimore Bike master plan and build bike lanes. We also need to improve our public transit so that less people use their cars. Parking and congestion are problems in the First District.</p>",
    "q2":"I believe that we have an enormous amount of work to do to shift the relationship between officers and the communities they serve. When I taught in Sandtown, I personally witnessed several incidents of officers getting rough with my middle school students. When I spoke to a sergeant about this recently, he told me that the younger officers were brought up in a culture that rewarded aggressive policing. He told me that we are still \"crawling our way out of zero-tolerance. Many of the young guys need to be trained how to walk a beat, and talk to people.\" That is a sad state of affairs.</p><p>That said, I believe Commissioner Davis is on the right track. I appreciate his commitment to foot patrol and community policing. He seems to understand that unless citizens, and particularly citizens of color become partners with the police, we will not be able to solve violent crime. I think it is still too early to tell whether his emphasis on \"post\" based policing will be effective.</p><p>Violent crime is still unacceptably high. I would continue to fund and expand evidence backed programs like Safe Streets. I would also like to see an expanded emphasis on treating drug addiction as a public health issue instead of criminality. I am encouraged by the partnership of BCPD, OSI and the Health Department.</p>",
    "q3":"The lesson I draw is that we can either invest in our young people now, or pay the consequences later. The day after the Unrest took place, my students and I held a \"Day of Listening.\" Over two hundred people came together to share ideas on how we could improve the city. Over and over again young people said that they felt like their voices were not being heard. They felt like the city had turned it's back on them. They spoke about rec centers closed, and promises broken. They spoke about the deteriorating condition of our schools. They spoke about systems being fundamentally broken. It is time that we listened to our young people.</p><p>I believe that we need to start by passing the Youth Investment Act. 3% is a relatively modest investment in our young people, but it's an important first step. I believe that we need universal pre-Kindergarten. We know that kid's brains are developing earlier and earlier. We need to rebuild the PAL Centers, and stop closing Rec Centers. </p><p>Overall, I think that the Unrest was symptomatic of a much deeper sickness. Our public policies have demonstrated a consistent disdain for our youth, and they have taken notice. The work ahead is about rebuilding trust. It is also about giving young people a voice in how we rebuild. They cannot continue to be ignored.</p>",
    "q4":"I believe that the current property tax structure is inequitable and prevents working and middle class people from purchasing a home. I favor a gradual reduction in property taxes coupled with a significant effort to recoup revenue from slum and absentee landlords. I think the city should use all tools at it's disposal including Vacants to Value and eminent domain to make it difficult for people to continue to sit on vacant properties. </p><p>In terms of development, I believe that the City Council and Mayor must be better advocates for citizens. We should demand enforcement of local hiring and PLA's (Project Labor Agreements) when we give out subsidies. I also think that we should be more strategic in leveraging TIF's and PILOT's to spur development in areas that otherwise could not be built. Our state representatives should amend the Geographic Cost of Educational Indexing formula so that our schools do not lose revenue when we provide tax incentives. Overall, I think that tax breaks for development should only be given to developers that value our communities by hiring local, unionized and living wage labor.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore can encourage commercial and residential revitalization by investing in people first. That means building high quality community schools. Creating tax incentives for public sector employees that chose to live in distressed neighborhoods. That means having universal pre-Kindergarten so that working parents can get back to work. That means strengthening the relationship between officers and the residents they serve. </p><p>Specifically, I think that we should aggressively fine people that sit on vacant, dilapidated or poor maintained property. If that doesn't work to shift behavior, then Baltimore should use eminent domain. I think the evidence on Vacants to Values is mixed in terms of it's overall impact, but I think it is a good tool that we should continue to use to induce revitalization. </p><p>I am encouraged that Governor Hogan has taken an interest in combatting blight, but the project will not be successful unless it truly provides uplift to our communities. During the time I taught in Sandtown there was significant investment in fixing up blighted housing. But it didn't work. It failed because the people living there were still unemployed. They still felt marginalized and disenfranchised. Drug dealing and police brutality did not subside. I hope that the Governor's program begins with the premise that we put Baltimore people to work. The first people to be hired for these reconstruction jobs should be city residents. We should hire unionized folks, as well as returning citizens. We should also engage communities to determine comes next.</p>",
    "q6":"There are several barriers to economic development and job creation:</p><p>Schools: Our schools are not producing 21st Century job ready graduates. When I taught in Sandtown, many of the children entering into six grade still couldn't read. I would like to see universal pre-K, expansion of community schools, and a new emphasis on the trades within our high school. We should do an analysis of the types of jobs that are going to be available in the next ten years and create schools to match that portfolio.</p><p>Returning citizens: Because of the failed War on Drugs and Zero Tolerance Policing, far too many of our citizens have criminal records and cannot find work. As Councilman, I would create a tax incentive for businesses that hire returning citizens. I would also push our unions to invest training capacity into returning citizens. </p><p>Bureaucracy: I have spent a lot of time listening to small businesses in the First District. They believe that the permitting process is mired in red tape. We should make it easier for people to start businesses in Baltimore. I would eliminate some of the minor privilege fees, and work on modernizing the permitting process. </p><p>Youth jobs: We should incentivize businesses through a tax credit to hire youth. I would also like to see the Mayor's Office of Economic Development start offering young people \"green jobs\" like they do in Howard County.</p>",
    "q7":"The current balance of power tilts too heavily toward the mayor. I would revive Councilman Henry's bill to allow the council to override the mayor's veto with just 2/3 instead of 3/4 votes. I would also introduce legislation to allow the Council to add money to the budget, instead of just being able to take out money. Finally, I would consider changing the Board of Estimates to only give one vote to the mayor. </p><p>I believe that the city is ready for a new alignment of power. But with that increased power comes a responsibility to talk to each other across lines of difference. The Council cannot continue to be a provincial body, where Members only advocate for projects in their own District. We need to start looking out for each other and recognizing that if I help get a rec center built in the 13th, that will help my constituents in the 1st because they may use it.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe the single most important piece of legislation to come out of the City Council in the last four years was Ban the Box. That legislation took courage. It gave returning citizens a foot in the door in the job hiring process. I also liked Councilman Scott's legislation to give public grades to restaurants. Other than that, I have not seen many bold ideas coming out of the Council. </p><p>I would like to see a City Council that shows true leadership on issues impacting the City. Council Members should be leading on affordable housing, school reform, police accountability, youth programming, job creation and other issues vital to Baltimore's well being. Too often the Council has been reactive instead of proactive. If we want to avoid another period of unrest, we need to respond directly to our citizens and push for legislation that addresses some of the route causes of the ills facing our city. I believe that the City Council can be a vehicle for positive transformation across the city, but we need to organize with our constituents and colleagues.</p>",
    "q9":"In the First District, we have significant issues with trash collection, street sweeping and getting the basics right. The result is that we have some neighborhoods that look terrible. We know this leads to blight and crime. </p><p>I also think that we need to improve schools and public transit. While the state technically controls the MTA and runs the school system in partnership with the Mayor, I think we need to do a better job of being actual partners. I would like to see the City take the lead on Governor Hogan's new City Link strategy and come up with a plan that actually makes sense for our citizens. I'd like to see us expand the Circulator. I'd like to see the City create partnerships between our schools and the Health Department, Police Department, Housing Department and other city agencies. </p><p>Overall, I think that many of the inefficiencies are caused by a lack of coordination between agencies. I would make sure that our agencies are working closely together and sharing data and ideas.</p>",
    "q10":"As a former teacher, and current Executive Director of a youth leadership non profit, I believe that Baltimore can be great. We have incredible communities made up of gritty, resilient, brilliant and loving citizens. We need a city government that matches the excellence of it's citizenry. Right now, city hall is part of the problem. I am running because I've watched young people struggle in ways they shouldn't have to. I'm running because so many of our civic institutions are broken, and I believe it will take a new voice to fix them. </p><p>I will be a Councilman that invests in our youth. I will be a Councilman that listens and responds to his constituents. I will be a Councilman that is accessible and accountable. I will build community across the First District, and with my colleagues in other parts of the city.</p>"

    "q1":"The concerns of First District residents are similar to those of people around the City: crime, taxes, and politicians who don't seem to listen or care. </p><p>Crime has spiked in the Southeast and we need to address how criminals are entering our community and why. Commanders in the Southeast have noted that public-private cooperation to monitor the routes used by offenders is key to a long-term crime fighting strategy as well as deploying our diminished police resources to proactively combat criminal behavior.</p><p>Baltimore will be nearly bankrupt within a decade. We must grow the population in order to grow the tax base or else suffer the consequences of our decades of reckless spending. We must reduce both the property tax rate and the personal property tax rates significantly (and 50% for the first two years of home ownership). We should also work to reduce property taxes in a formula commensurate with population growth.</p><p>We need immediate and continuous audits of all City agencies and programs getting over $1M of taxpayer money. From schools to police and everything in between, there is a trust deficit in Baltimore. Until our City can show that its leaders can be effective stewards of citizens' hard-earned money, the books need to be opened and corruption must be rooted out. No new spending should be authorized unless a provision is incorporated that requires comprehensive and continuous audits and oversight of how any money is used.</p>",
    "q2":"I have confidence that the vast majority of Baltimore's Police Officers and members of the Sheriff's Department are doing everything in their power to make our community safe. I have confidence in the Commissioner and want to give him the resources that he and his commanders need to effectively secure the City.</p><p>Baltimore must be a leader in the national dialogue about policing. The failed war on drugs has led to mass incarcerations and distrust between police and the communities they serve. This problem has been decades in the making and cannot be fixed overnight. Smart economics is the ultimate solution to crime: a person with a 9-5 will not be motivated to stay up until 4am selling drugs. The \"demand side\" solutions to crime (treating addiction as a public health concern, making it less-profitable to sell drugs than to get an honest job, and providing housing and business ownership opportunities) are the future. Baltimore should be a leader in this regard.</p><p>A long-term plan notwithstanding, Baltimore is still reeling from its most violent year (per capita) on record. Police must work with the State's Attorney's Office, as well as federal law enforcement, to identify the most violent actors and the ringleaders of Baltimore's most dangerous organizations. </p><p>In the Southeast, officers and commanders have suggested that targeting resources towards cutting off the way criminals enter and move through the First District is smart policing that could immediately do good for residents.</p>",
    "q3":"Baltimore's struggles were laid bare to the nation last year. We must not withdraw from the spotlight, but rather become a national example of turnaround and recovery.</p><p>We all know that the unrest following Freddie Gray's death wasn't a week, or a month, or even a year in the making. Decades of economic decline, unkept promises, mass incarceration, and generations left behind created the powder keg that sat waiting for the match. As much as it pained us to watch national media covering riots in the streets, it was almost more upsetting to see the lack of coverage when people from across the City (far more than the group who created the unrest) came together to clean up.</p><p>The same neighborhoods that were on fire in 1968 burned again in 2016. It is unforgivable that, in fifty years, the economic and social concerns of our City's residents have been ignored in favor of a machine that has left them behind.</p><p>The lesson I draw from the death of Freddie Gray is that we must encourage ownership in Baltimore. The best way to turn our City around is to help people climb the economic ladder and pass on prosperity to their children instead of a sense of longing and despair.</p>",
    "q4":"Property taxes must be lowered in Baltimore. The fact that residents and business owners are paying more-than-double their counterparts anywhere else in the State is an absurdity. Growth in Baltimore is stagnant and, in order to offset a significant financial downturn approaching bankruptcy within the decade, Baltimore needs more residents. The only way to get people to come here in the short term is to make the City more affordable (if we weren't on the verge of insolvency, we would also want to expand services, but any expansion at this point would accelerate the decline). </p><p>An immediate and significant cut, halving the property tax for the first two years of ownership, slashing rates for small businesses and startups, and cutting rates commensurate with growth going forward are the ways we can grow Baltimore and avoid a financial catastrophe.</p><p>Development is essential to bring businesses to Baltimore. However, \"development for development's sake\" isn't what Baltimore needs. A prime example of this is a proposed historic overlay for Fells Point currently being met with resistance by the current City Council. Essentially, the overlay would create a building height restriction in historic Fells. The fact that we need this restriction shows the fear that residents have that development for the sake of development would not preserve the historic quality of our communities. We must undertake to revitalize and encourage businesses while also understanding the uniqueness of Baltimore's neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q5":"When I worked for the Office of the State's Attorney in the Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Unit, I had the sad occasion to visit the scenes of where some of the most violent and disturbing crimes in our City were taking place: vacant homes. Not only are these sites of drugs, crime, prostitution, human trafficking, and violence, but they are also places where human tragedy goes unseen and unreported. </p><p>I fully support the Governor's effort to reduce blight in our City and I commend the Mayor for her efforts to accelerate removal of vacant houses.This is a bipartisan issue where we all are committed to making the City a better place for all of its residents.</p><p>With regard to revitalization of neighborhoods, we need to make Baltimore more affordable. Large property tax reductions for individual home buyers as well as encouragement for businesses to bring jobs into the City will help to transform communities.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier to economic development in our City is City government. Businesses want to come to Baltimore and people want to live here. However, when they realize the cost of Baltimore and what they get in exchange for such a high rate, they look elsewhere. </p><p>Lowering property taxes, especially for new home buyers, is a critical first step to growing the tax base in the City. As much as we would want to immediately spend more on the myriad of \"quality of life\" issues that our City has, there is a looming budgetary shortfall that will be catastrophic for the City within the decade. It is critical that we get more people in the City and balance our financial outlook before we decide it's time to spend more on programs. </p><p>When the City is taxing small businesses more-than-double anywhere else in the State, is it any wonder that we are losing out on millions of dollars of venture spending despite having some of the best medical and technological infrastructure in the country. Baltimore must emulate other tech-focused cities and make starting a business in Baltimore easier. We need to realize that these businesses are not just \"white coat\" jobs, but also can provide countless, salaried, jobs to Baltimoreans looking for work. Coupled with on-the-job-training and health benefits, these are the kinds of jobs that can help someone buy their first home or eventually start a business of their own.</p>",
    "q7":"How can there be a balance of power without transparency? The balance between the Mayor and Council is less important than the balance between the politicians and the people. It is outrageous that audits are no completed while the City hurtles headlong towards default. Decades of failed policies have led to a situation where City Schools can report operating losses in the tens-of-millions of dollars and yet no bureaucrats are fired.</p><p>People are looking for voices outside of \"business as usual.\" I think people get into politics at the local level for many noble reasons. However, as we've seen consistently played out in both the Mayor's Office and City Council, having a full-slate of single-viewpoints leads to no oversight. </p><p>Even just one voice calling the system to account on behalf of the taxpayers and residents of the City would be an improvement over the status quo.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council's primary role should be the growth and preservation of Baltimore. The Council must be both the steward of the City's finances and the overseer of the City's expenditures. The Council's role is to maintain transparency in government and make sure that members' constituents' voices are heard at City Hall.</p><p>The most important issue that comes before the Council each year is the City's budget. While the Council does not have full control over budgetary amendment, it is within the Council's purview to question and demand accountability on the spending of taxpayer money. Unfortunately, for decades, the Council has generally failed in this responsibility.</p><p>The Council's numerous votes on allowing for property tax reductions to bring businesses into Baltimore have been important, yet controversial, stepping stones towards growth. The unfortunate consequence of these tax breaks has been, as we are seeing this year, a mis- assessment in the State's education funding formula that calculates total taxable income in local jurisdictions in the allocation of State aid. Baltimore's legislators were right to try to bring businesses to Baltimore, but needed to think of the consequences of those actions. A simple change to the State's education budget formula (likely to be well-received since a stronger business climate in Baltimore is good for the region) could have saved millions.</p>",
    "q9":"We are all painfully aware after the heavy snowfall this winter that the City is often painfully reactive to problems instead of proactive.</p><p>One major example of this is the crumbling urban infrastructure. For decades, we have taken few steps to expand and modernize roads and water/wastewater distribution. Now, we have to deal with exorbitantly high water bills (some so high that residents are being foreclosed on because they cannot afford to pay), water-main bursts, sewage leakages, and crippling traffic. Let's be clear: these problems are the result of decades of inaction and inattention. </p><p>While the delivery of services, water issues, and congestion cannot be fixed overnight, we can take steps to encourage modernization, preventative maintenance, and the coordination with regional partners to allow for innovation and cooperation between jurisdictions for coordination of projects.</p><p>These issues are where residents are better suited than government to pinpoint where services are lacking. Rather than a top-down approach or a one-size-fits-all route to services, we need to listen to what our communities need and work to meet and surpass expectations. Through modernization and the cutting of waste and fraud, we should expect to see an increase in efficiency and responsiveness of City services.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office because Baltimore City is verging on insolvency within the decade. Lowering taxes, initiating audits, and providing transparency while opening up bipartisan dialogue are the keys to my message. Our City's economy must improve in order for our communities to thrive. As a property owner and an outsider to Baltimore's political machine, I am ready to bring accountability to our City's leadership.</p>"

    "q1":"The top three issues in my district are crime, redevelopment and infrastructure needs. Crime in the 2nd District varies from neighborhood to neighborhood. While homicides and shootings are not as common in other areas they do happen thus a focus on the violent repeat offenders causing them. In addition, property crime like burglaries, larceny from autos and stolen autos are the most common of which citizens complain about. We have already started a combined effort to address with police via emails, Citizen on Patrol and data sharing. The plan is to further those partnerships moving to having a daytime NECOP in addition to our well known night time COP. Furthermore, 300menmarch will continue to be out in Belair Edison the most violent part of the district where we have seen a reduction of incidents during our engagements. Before I was elected I vowed to create a plan and begin to redevelop the Belair Road Corridor. We have done that with over $9 million in private investments including the city's first Planet Fitness and a new shopping center alongside Bi-Rite. We have also spent city dollars on a Belair Road TAP Study along with a Market Study that shows the buying power of our area. More development will come as I will continue to lobby and work for it. During my term I have been able to increase street paving projects in a area that had often been forgotten. I will continue to have more projects placed in the city's plan.</p>",
    "q2":"Focusing on violent repeat offenders has proven to be a strategy that works in Baltimore providing two of our least violent years in 2011 and 2014. However, in law enforcement strategies must be constantly updated and tweaked in order to remain effective. I believe that the current leadership at BPD is capable of doing just that but as I always say crime reduction goes well beyond BPD. If we are truly going to address the issue of violence in the long run we must look at violence from the angle of every agency (from Housing to Recreation and Parks) and organization in Baltimore. Moreover, we must begin addressing the issue long before someone becomes the victim or perpetrator of a crime. If Baltimore wants to become even more serious about crime reduction we must invest more dollars in front end programming along with public safety. For example, many statistics show us which young people are most likely to become the victim or perpetrator of a crime as early as 3rd grade. What would crime look like if we invested in Family Strengthening Programs that followed those young people and their families. Of course we must also continue to expand opportunities for young people, create jobs for all and deal with addiction. in my district we currently are holding mediation training with police and teens from the area. In addition, we hold coffee with a cop, late night hoops with a cop and other programs. We will continue these and expand.</p>",
    "q3":"Freddie Gray's death and the unrest that followed did not have to happen for me to understand the issues that have been highlighted in it's wake. I have lived in and with those issues for most of my life growing up poor young and black in Baltimore. However, for me what April provided was proof that some needed throughout our city that we must have significant change to how we operate. Above of all else following April to me its clear that we all must do more if we truly want Baltimore to be more. Everyone, who says they loves Baltimore politicians, business leaders, religious leaders, athletes and all citizens must do more to make our city a better place. In city government that means that we must look at changing everything about the way we operate to the way we elect our leaders. In addition, City Government must clearly be more transparent in order to regain trust with the citizens which is why I am pushing a Open Data Bill that will hopefully pass the council. Moreover, we have to invest in rebuilding relationships and increasing accountability between law enforcement and citizens. I am proud to have been a member of the body camera task force but know that is not enough. Programs like the youth mediation training we are holding in Northeast Baltimore are just one example. Lastly we must figure out a way to harness the energy we saw in April into significant changes in Baltimore.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore must figure out a way to continuously lower its property tax rate. This is something that has happened in recent years but must be expanded. However, cutting the property tax rate at a faster past could mean interruption of some of the services that citizens depend on. That is why I believe that one must take a delicate balanced approach when considering to lower the rate. I believe that one solution to that problem is increasing the rate for vacant or blighted properties. Moreover, I believe there must be serious conversation on the impact of Non Profit and other non property tax paying properties on the city. I believe TIFS and PILOTS have their place in the world but must be done in new ways that have a greater impact on the city and neighborhoods in which they are in. I believe that we must begin to include stronger Project Labor Agreements and local hiring in connection to these types of project and will advocate for this especially in my district. In addition, I believe we must begin to figure out ways to have those receiving the assistance to invest immediately in ways that benefit the city well beyond the projects target area especially our most needy areas. Lastly, in connection to TIFs and PILOTs we must fight to have education formulas changed to consider their impact.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore can strengthen its efforts to conduct commercial and residential revitalization beyond downtown by being stronger in its efforts to show how great our neighborhoods are. Moreover, I believe it is the duty of the local district elected representatives to be the champion for their areas. In my district the Belair Road Route 1 corridor has long been full of vacant care businesses as it has in every area that it touches across the east coast. The city had no interest in touting this area as a place to redevelop but I demanded that it be done starting with the Belair Road TAP Study and the market study that followed. That market study that shows the strong neighborhoods along the corridor with a huge buying power was used to entice a new $4 million development alongside Bi-Rite and the first city Planet Fitness near by. We were also able to work with a property owner to redevelop another old car lot into community supported businesses In addition, we were able to advocate and receive funding for a upcoming street scape project that will make the area even more desirable for development. Development can happen beyond downtown but it must be fought for consistently. Vacants to Value has had a different impact in different areas in the city. In Northeast Baltimore the programs focus on the few vacant properties has allowed us to be successful in having properties resold. In fact two zipcodes 21214 and 21206 featured in the Baltimore Sun.</p>",
    "q6":"For all the development that has happened and jobs that have been created in the city in recent years there are still many issues that prevent us from taking the next step. One of those issues that I believe goes unspoken is our image. I strongly believe the incorrect perception of our city and certain areas has held those areas back from receiving much needed development. For example imagine if the work done by Come Home Baltimore in Oliver which has transformed the blocks where The Wire was filmed was supported by large scale project developers. How many more jobs would have been created in rebuilding a neighborhood? Moreover, inefficiencies within city government are another huge barrier to job creation. Those who wish to open businesses, build homes or businesses that will create jobs often come to the council in order to seek assistance in dealing with outdated and slow bureaucracy. Baltimore needs to streamline and modernize all of its permit and procurement processes in order to lift a big burden on economic development in the city. In addition, we all know that property taxes and other fees are also a factor in making those interested in development shy away from the city. Our fees and taxes must be evaluated. Lastly, we must figure out a way to have many of our residents who are 2nd chance citizens benefit from the job creation in the city.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe that the entire city charter needs to be look at and updated where needed to regain public trust and mordernize city government. For example, much focus has been on possible changes to the BOE structure. I agree that the structure should change but I think that there is a better change then the proposed reducing the board to just the elected representatives who currently sit on it. Councilmembers are often criticized for decisions made by the BOE of which they have nothing to do with. Yes I understand the Council President chairs the board but he is elected citywide and in a different manner then the council. I believe we should restructure the BOE by removing the DPW Director and placing the Council Vice President in that position. I believe this solution is a better way to balance the power of BOE. In addition,, I believe it is time for Baltimore to join most major cities in having open primary elections. No one should take office after winning a primary with less than majority support but, in Baltimore we often see persons elected after receiving 30 or 40 percent of the vote. This is unacceptable and opening up the primary to a runoff style would prevent this. Lastly, I strongly believe that we must look at the way the council is structured, I believe the council can be more effective and more representative of the entire city while being smaller. I will be introducing legislation to address.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe the Council has been focused on many of the important issues during this term. However, I believe there are some that we have not addressed or spent enough time addressing. Personally I reinstated quarterly oversight hearings of BPD to deal with the crime fight throughout the term which had not happened during the previous term. Moreover, the public safety committee held hearings in reference to in-custody deaths, body cameras, racial profiling and even car stops. In addition, we have tackled speed cameras, local hiring and just passed a new youth program funding bill. However, I believe we must go further in the next term. In order to truly address needs for youth we must first have the data to analyze what is being used and how taxpayer dollars is being spent. Although I introduced it this term we must fully consider moving to a onecard muncipal I.D. system to truly know what our youth want. Moreover, family strengthening programs like The Center For Urban Families can play a huge roll in the future of our city. As a Council we must champion these types of organizations and push for funding to help these programs expand across the city. The next City Council must also continue to focus in on crime but, also must spend more time analyzing data and other basic services provided to citizens. From trash pick up to street paving must be looked it to truly hold the agencies responsible.</p>",
    "q9":"The number one issue with 311 and city services is that there is no way for citizens to follow up and know exactly what was done by which agency on their request. This must change in order for citizens to understand and truly be satisfied with the services. Moreover, once we pass the pending open data legislation it will be important to have agencies share data on types of requests and where they come from in order to help citizens better understand how the services are conducted. In addition, while many citizens in my district constantly thank me for being the reason their street finally received a snow plow after 40 plus years we must improve the tracking of our snow removal efforts. I personally believe the current DOT Director has implemented the best snow removal in my lifetime but, we can be better by using gps and other data that we can share with citizens. In fact the key to improving all city services is using data to not only make them more efficient but, also making them more transparent and open to the citizenry. The council must also focus on this data to improve services in their areas as no one knows a district like the person elected to represent it.</p>",

    "q1":"The issues of the district are inseparable from the issues of the city as a whole. We are a population of taxpayers whose quality of life is not improving due to generations of disinvestment and racism, whose money is unaccounted for, and whose practical outlook and reasonable expectations of city hall have been overlooked and discounted.</p><p>I will work to dismantle policies that perpetuate institutional racism and replace them with ones that seek to build racial equity. I will start by introducing legislation within my first 100 days in office to increase the minimum wage to at least $15/hr and index it to inflation, support inclusionary zoning and housing requirements and the development of permanently affordable housing, and push our district and our city to build on a vision of transit equity that will help individuals, families, and small business prosper, making main streets like Harford Road, rather than the Inner Harbor, more livable centers of economic growth.</p><p>I will address financial accountability by supporting audits for every city agency, scrutinizing the budget, supporting the appointment of transformative leaders to top positions, and holding city officials accountable through public hearings.</p><p>I will address the concerns of constituents by being a full-time councilman, having an office in the district, and holding regular town-hall meetings.</p><p>Having spent two decades involved in our city's arts culture, I will seek the continued advancement of artists and the arts in setting and furthering an agenda for the city and our neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q2":"As councilman I will consider any nationally established best practice that provides a progressive solution to violent crime. This includes the full legalization of marijuana—and driving down drug demand through innovative public health solutions such as needle exchange programs, expanded mental health services, and expanded transitional housing and drug treatment programs.</p><p>We will see a reduction in violent crime when the income gap between white and black families in Baltimore closes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median income for White families in Baltimore is $60,550— the median income for black families is $33,610.</p><p>Put an additional $26,940 into the average black household, and I guarantee there would be an immediate and dramatic reduction in crime.</p><p>The sheer depth of our economic woes has created a crime problem that is beyond the control of the police department.</p><p>I'm the only candidate in the race for 3rd District Council that has pledged to introduce at minimum a $15/hr minimum wage, so that the average worker can at least afford a roof over their heads and the basic necessities for their families.</p>",
    "q3":"I learned that there is a dear price to pay for pursuing racist and economically divisive policies that lead to a lack of affordable housing, poor health outcomes for low income neighborhoods, food deserts, terrible schools, an oppressive police force, disparate transit systems, uncontrollable violent crime, and another uprising.</p><p>I learned that the people in Sandtown-Winchester deserve the same quality of life as my neighbors in Mayfield.</p><p>Our economy has collapsed. Baltimore needs progressive, responsive, and aggressive leadership to address the enormous challenges that were laid bare during the uprising.</p><p>That's why I've pledged to be a fulltime councilman. I've pledged to open an office in the district. I will fight for complete streets projects in my district so that our businesses will see greater foot and cycle traffic. And I will support affordable housing developments, recreational centers, and the arts—so that all of my constituents can enjoy a vibrant, diverse, and economically inclusive community.</p>",
    "q4":"I will support a common sense plan put forth by our next Mayor that cuts property taxes in a responsible and progressive manner. Baltimore has the highest property tax rate in the State. In exchange Baltimore residents enjoy one of the highest murder rates per capita in the United States of America, an economy in shambles, a disconnected transit system, terrible schools, food deserts, and shortened life expectancies. We must invest directly into our communities— it is the only way to tear down the longstanding pillars of institutional racism and systemic inequality.</p><p>I have said repeatedly that I will oppose any PILOTs, TIFs, or other economic development incentives for downtown development projects without similar investments in neighborhoods outside of the inner harbor/downtown business district.</p>",
    "q5":"As an artist I see the value of the vacant housing inventory in Baltimore. I support— Artist Driven Development— a nationally recognized best practice that recruits artists to turn blighted properties into diversified cultural centers. Station North is a perfect example of how creatives can rejuvenate a neighborhood.</p><p>We should also send more of our youths and citizens with a criminal history into the building trades to increase the local construction workforce. Converting our large pool of chronically under and unemployed youth and returning citizens into skilled laborers will dramatically increase the pace, effectiveness, and economic impact of the demolition and rehab efforts taking place throughout Baltimore.</p><p>Imagine City government taking possession of hundreds of thousands of vacant properties, and employing thousands of local residents to do tear down or reconstruction at fair union wages. Imagine that a significant portion of this housing stock came in the form of loans to City residents similar to FHA's 203K program that are backed by contributions from developers in exchange for tax incentives for large commercial development projects.</p>",
    "q6":"Wages:</p><p>We also must do better to develop our workforce into the future. Since I began my campaign, I have supported the city passing a minimum wage of at least $15/hour. This wage would not only assure that workers had enough income to support themselves and their families, but it will promote a higher quality workforce that wants to stay in Baltimore.</p><p>Transportation:</p><p>We have a light rail that only runs north and south; we have a circulator that only services white neighborhoods; we have a metrobus line that is completely unreliable; and we have a subway system that only runs north and south. But the worst part about Baltimore's four flawed mass transit systems, is that our elected officials never bothered to connect all four in AT LEAST ONE LOCATION.</p><p>The Central Maryland Transportation Alliance recently awarded the region a \"D\" grade for its transportation system. And while many municipalities around the nation are investing in transit, Baltimore lags behind with the loss of the Red Line. Our system makes it difficult for people to get to jobs, and stifles the city's ability to attract a quality workforce and new businesses.</p><p>We must address our transportation problems by shortening travel times on all modes of transportation, and that can only happen if we work with the state to ensure that MTA's proposed Baltimore Link becomes a success. We must create an infrastructure for commuting and traveling, like additional bike facilities and better pedestrian access to job centers.</p>",
    "q7":"I do not believe in a \"strong mayor\" style of municipal government. I'm sure the next mayor of Baltimore will disagree with me, but I think that the council should reduce the percentage of votes necessary to override the veto from ¾ to ⅔. </p><p>The relatively increased power for each individual council member means a greater responsibility to scrutinize and take a position on a bill, increasing transparency and responsibility for each council member, holding them more accountable to constituents, and improving morale for citizen engagement with their representatives—something that isn't happening currently.</p><p>Third District Councilman recently voted in support of body cameras along with the rest of his colleagues, before he supported Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's veto of the bill.</p><p>It was one of the few times he showed up to work—as the Sun reported \"Curran has been absent for the highest percentage of committee votes… missing about 60 of 110 votes.\"</p><p>When I win this election, my constituents will know that they have a full time representative with an office in the district, who is engaged in the legislative process. We need an innovative council that seeks policy solutions that will bring an end to our systemic issues with racism and inequality.</p>",
    "q8":"The Baltimore City Council hasn't passed any significant progressive policies other than Ban the Box—which we are still waiting for comprehensive data detailing its impact. Everything else has been tax hikes for residents, and tax giveaways for developers.</p><p>Our council is largely unimaginative, unmotivated, and complacent. City residents—especially in the 3rd District—are ready for change. They are ready for a leader who will tackle the systemic issues plaguing our city with creative, responsible, and prudent public policy. I am that leader.</p>",
    "q9":"Baltimore City Police Officers are sworn to protect and to serve the residents of this City. Unfortunately, the department as a whole is not living up to this mission. The department's morale is low, community trust is virtually non-existent, and the department finds itself short-staffed and over-budget fiscal year after fiscal year.</p><p>I was especially disappointed to see the police department engage in a work slow down in response to the charges against the 6 officers allegedly involved in Freddie Gray's death. I believe that the slowdown had deadly consequences. <P></P>The Police Department is the most essential service provider in all of City Government. As councilman I will work with police commanders to determine how best to recruit more officers to the force—and more importantly to live in the City. Eliminating the vacancies will reduce the overtime expenditures that create annual budget overruns. And having more officers on patrol will decrease response times for non-violent crimes.</p><p>As councilman I will also steer police resources toward cultural sensitivity and mental illness awareness training. Coupled with a fully implemented body camera program, residents will experience significantly more professional and positive interactions with our police. I believe that these positive interactions will restore the community's trust in the BPD, which will in turn lead to greater community cooperation in criminal investigations, which will ultimately reduce crime.</p>",
    "q10":"The 3rd District needs a PROGRESSIVE leader. If elected I will work full time to eliminate the the divisive policies that have created extreme poverty, poor education, high crime, disturbing public health outcomes, and an absence of affordable housing.</p><p>The institutional racism and systemic inequalities that lead to the civil unrest we saw last year must come to an end. I'm running to completely overhaul our racist institutions of power. We cannot afford anything less.</p>"

    "q1":"The most pressing issue for most of my constituents is some permutation of crime, whether it's the broader \"quality of life\" crime that pervades even those areas that aren't challenged with serious or violent crime, or the open air drug markets on the edges of some of my neighborhoods. Solving some of our other big picture issues still won't make a smashed car window, or constant litter in the gutters and on the sidewalks, or an all-night fraternity party going on next door, any less annoying; anecdotally speaking, more people have complained to me about leaving the City because of these nuisances than because their taxes were too high.</p><p>Better enforcement of my Late Night Commercial Operations program has shown positive results, as had the new Social Host citation program that Councilwoman Clarke and I worked on last year. Both have given the police an important tool for reining in problem businesses on commercial corridors and inside neighborhoods, as well as nuisance or party houses.</p><p>With the open-air drug markets, we ​waste millions each year recirculating people ​through the system for possession and other non-violent offenses. LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion) - a program I helped bring to Baltimore - allows police officers to divert individuals committing low-level crimes - typically drug-related offenses - away from formal arrest and prosecution and instead into an intensively-managed social services program. Implemented properly, LEAD should reduce other nuisance crimes as those in treatment are no longer committing daily thefts to support their addiction.</p>",
    "q2":"First, we need to improve relations between the police and the communities they're sworn to serve and protect. The police cannot do their jobs without our trust and support, but both of those things need to be earned through transparency, accountability, constant communication, and more direct community engagement. The City Council has passed two of my resolutions asking for changes in state law to address this: one would create a Police Commission - volunteer citizens, nominated by the Mayor, confirmed by the Council after a public hearing - which would hire, fire, and supervise a Chief of Police and set policy for the department, while the other would strengthen the Civilian Review Board.</p><p>Second, while I support the Police Department's leadership and current strategy of targeting violent crime and offenders, I also recognize that it is purely one of law enforcement; a comprehensive long-term solution to reducing violent crime involves major changes to the ways we approach education, recreation, housing, job training, and drug treatment. We should be suspicious of anyone who says we can simply police our way out of our current situation. If we really want to create a sustainable society with less violent crime, we will need to ensure that everyone has access to a decent education, quality affordable housing, and a job that can support them. This will be challenging and will require a great deal of political will – to re-invest in both Baltimore's physical infrastructure, and the human capital that will be Baltimore's future.</p>",
    "q3":"When I reflect back on the uprising, the metaphor that comes to mind is chickens coming home to roost. </p><p>Here in Baltimore City we've spent the better part—or perhaps I should call it the worst part—of the last generation and a half disinvesting in the human capital of our communities. Compared with 25 years ago, the police budget in Baltimore City is almost three times larger than it was. Alternatively, in the 1980s we had 81 recreation centers, where we now have 39 of them. Some say that our population has dropped since then, but it hasn't been cut in half, and certainly the number of City kids who need rec centers hasn't been cut in half. </p><p>There is just no getting around the fact that over that period, our city government has made a conscious and proactive decision to put more resources into police and fewer resources into youth development. We are spending significantly less on recreation than we were a generation ago, even though the City's budget has doubled. Both a well-managed well-trained police department and comprehensive and strategic opportunities for all of our young people are necessary for true and lasting public safety, but investing serious resources only in the police has led to an unbalanced, unsuccessful result - exemplified both in the individual case of Freddie Gray and in the uprising afterwards.</p>",
    "q4":"I think that reducing our property tax rate is an important goal. One immediate way to do so would be to restructure some of our targeted tax credits into blanket rate reductions. For example, the Targeted Homeowners Tax Credit is projected - by 2020 - to provide the equivalent of a 20-cent reduction to owner-occupied properties, while providing no relief to renters or businesses. For the same cost in revenue to the City, we could have simply reduced our property rate by 12 cents for everyone; while it would be a smaller benefit for some residents, it would create a measure of relief for all residents, while also spurring broader reinvestment.</p><p>My thoughts on tax increment financing, payments in lieu of taxes and other incentives are nuanced; I come from a community development background and I have an appreciation of the importance of closing gaps in a development budget. Providing assistance to a project which would not happen without assistance is usually a prudent investment. The amount of assistance provided, however, needs to be carefully scrutinized. While I'm generally supportive of financing the streets and sewers and other capital improvements that should be government's responsibility in the first place, I have made a distinction when it comes to greenspace and recreational sites, believing that those should be looked at in the context of the City's commitment to such infrastructure citywide.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore needs a neighborhood-level community development strategy. We live in a City with only two-thirds of the population we had half-a-century ago, but with much of the same infrastructure. There are square blocks of houses all over the City that are mostly vacant and abandoned; the recent foreclosure crisis has now also increased the inventory of vacants scattered throughout the City in otherwise strong neighborhoods. While some of these will eventually be rehabbed through Vacants to Value, Baltimore Housing's own estimates are that about two-thirds will probably never attract the combination of financing, subsidy, and vision needed for successful rehab.</p><p>These houses need to be demolished and Governor Hogan's commitment to the effort is welcome. Where consistent with a community-based master plan, remaining residents on mostly-blighted blocks could even be relocated nearby, so that whole blocks can be cleared. While some of these cleared lots would become strategic development opportunities for housing, retail, office space, or a combination, most of them could be small and medium-sized green spaces: community gardens, small play areas, or just well-maintained grass lots. Thousands of small and medium-sized green spaces would have not only the environmental benefits of increasing the City's storm water management capacity and tree canopy, but would also provide the economic benefit of increasing the value of the remaining nearby houses - which would now be parkfront property! - and by doing so, build our tax base.</p>",
    "q6":"Last year, the Opportunity Collaborative Workforce Development Committee identified several major challenges for workforce development. As a local government, Baltimore City must face the reality that many of our low-skilled adults lack basic reading and basic math skills, many of our low-income workers face transportation barriers while traveling to and from work, and about one in five job seekers in the region report that they have a criminal record that is a barrier to employment. </p><p>We need to provide high schools with the funding to implement basic adult education courses, by allowing them to count young adults enrolled in GED classes as part of their student body. We should look at implementing adult education charter schools, following an approach used in the District of Columbia, where some adult education charter schools provide a combination of basic adult education to prepare for the GED, while concurrently receiving job skills training and support services that increase student success. This would be easier if City government actually controlled City public schools, but that's another conversation.</p><p>I'm already at work on revamping our Inclusionary Housing Program so that it actually provides more affordable housing, to better address the needs of low-income workers, but we clearly need to be doing a lot better. We also need the MTA's plan for BaltimoreLink to provide a truly workable mass transit solution for the hundreds of thousands of Baltimoreans who have no other way to move between home, work, and school.</p>",
    "q7":"We need a more balanced power dynamic between branches of government. Three years ago, I introduced legislation designed to restructure some of the basic practices and institutions of Baltimore City government. The four charter amendments would have to be ratified by the voters at a general election, either if the City Council passes them and the Mayor signs them, or if they are placed on the ballot by petition of the citizenry.</p><p>While the level of turnover that the Council is poised to have this year would seem to reduce the need for the term limits amendment, the other three - and their ability to positively impact the power dynamic between the City Council and the Mayor, while still retaining the main tenants of our \"strong mayor\" system of government - are still very relevant politically.</p><p>While many of us have been on occasion frustrated by the \"strong mayor\" system, from a pure policy perspective, it does provide maximum accountability for the citizens – the Mayor has most of the power, and with most of the power comes most of the responsibility. However, in our current system, the Mayor is so \"strong\" that it makes it hard for the supposed check-and-balance between the executive branch and the legislative branch to function. Giving the Council the ability to truly amend the budget, override vetoes with a more conventional 2/3rds supermajority, and reducing the Council's size would address that dysfunction.</p><p>For more specifics, go to https://www.facebook.com/notes/councilman-bill-henry/thoughts-on-restructuring-baltimore-city-government/1179634005399043</p>",
    "q8":"Some of the biggest issues facing our City - education, public safety, housing - are difficult for us to address directly; technically, the City has no legal control over the schools, the police department, or the housing authority, so we can't pass legislation directly affecting them. Still, we hold hearings into subjects which need to be addressed by other elected officials, promoting open and public dialogue on issues such as civil marriage, liquor regulation, and deaths in police custody.</p><p>However, in this term alone, the City Council has set policy. We created a licensure process - with community input - for businesses that impact residents and want to be open late at night. We've set up a demolition approval process - with community input - for City-owned buildings in neighborhoods, and instituted a citation process for the hosts of unruly social events. We have done a comprehensive revision of our Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation and its operations, broadened the definition of vacant houses to include a wider group of exterior conditions, and prohibited automated purchasing machines which provided cash for cellphones and other electronics. </p><p>Of course, those are just bills that I sponsored - or cosponsored - during this term. We also set up a licensure process for food trucks, instituted \"ban the box\" practices in the City for most employers, and created a stormwater remediation program - all on top of the hundreds of rezonings and various plan amendments which allow development to proceed in Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q9":"Going door-to-door in Cedarcroft during an earlier run for the Council, I met a young mother. She complained that her real anger was not at the high property taxes she was paying – which she could cut in half by moving a few blocks north – but at the fact that she didn't feel that the services she was getting in return justified the high taxes. I believe people don't mind paying more for something, if they feel they're getting more in return. </p><p>An attitude readjustment is needed throughout Baltimore City government, especially in terms of a more customer service-oriented bureaucracy. Many Baltimoreans wax nostalgic for the Schaefer Administration, for his \"do it now\" attitude. The story of a Mayor calling a staff person and telling them that he had seen an abandoned car on his way to work and wanting it gone by the time he went home resonates with residents who have become accustomed to the City taking days or even weeks to address the simplest tasks.</p><p>As a Council member, this frustrates me even more than it does most of my constituents, since I have the honor and privilege of being a point of collection for such complaints, but neither the power nor authority to order them addressed. My hope and prayer is that the next Mayor will be one who acknowledges that doing the little things right and quickly is just as important as rolling out the sweeping policy initiatives which make headlines.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm from here, I went to school here, and now I'm raising my family here. I want my kids to grow up in a Baltimore that they'll want to stay in also. Throughout my schooling, my career, and my civic engagement, my goal has always been to figure out how Baltimore could be better and then make it happen; I've spent most of my adult life working with individuals and organizations similarly committed to that goal. Whether that effort was focused on the neighborhoods of Greater Homewood, the York-Greenmount Corridor, Patterson Park, or the City as a whole, all of the various takeaways from those endeavors - and my work on the Council to date - have contributed to making me the best candidate to keep representing the 4th District in Baltimore City Council.</p>"

    "q1":"Key issues in the district include high crime and property taxes, but there is a broader pressing issue that needs immediate attention. District 5 has great diversity. It has affluent, middle class and impoverished neighborhoods, each with their own priorities and concerns. There are neighborhoods where most people work, and sections where unemployment is a key concern because there aren't jobs or sufficient affordable child-care, or the residents don't have proper education or training.</p><p>The next councilperson needs to represent and fight for all of the diverse communities. While lowering crime and taxes is important, some sectors care more about good schools or affordable housing. We must be able to address all the issues, without prioritizing one sector more than another. We need short- and long-term solutions, through community partnerships, legislative, and non-legislative solutions. I am always cultivating relationships, walking the streets to hear problems, and ready to roll up my sleeves to take action. I will create opportunities and activities that bring the leaders of diverse communities together to play a hands-on role in improving relationships and, subsequently, solve some of the problems we face.</p><p>Beyond building stronger relationships within my district, I plan to establish close relationships with colleagues on the city council, brainstorming solutions that impact similar communities and exploring ways to help the entire city while prioritizing my district's needs and constituents. </p>",
    "q2":"Recent changes in police department personnel and upcoming turnover in City Hall will provide new opportunities in the fight against crime. The Governor's announcement of state funds for city police programs offers optimism, but we must continue to work with the state and federal government to tap into other funding and resources. </p><p>As an advisory board member with a local safety patrol group, as well as an appointed community liaison to the State's Attorney's office, I have first-hand seen the dramatic increase in crime in my district and fighting crime will be a priority.</p><p>While developing police-community relationships is vital, we need strategies to reduce violent crime, including sufficient resources for law enforcement. Several months ago, I suggested in a community forum that the Mayor allocate resources to expand the crime lab, which hadn't had a staff expansion since the 1970s. The mayor acted quickly and the crime lab now has the resources to treat more crime scenes. That is one of many necessary activities.</p><p>We need more police walking/riding their beats; greater police presence in the community scares off criminals while enabling local residents to increase their trust, and allows the police to learn more about the locals, their interests and their lives.</p><p>We also have to focus on alternatives to lives of crime; providing job training and work opportunities for returning residents is critical. We have some good programs, such as at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and I will work with local businesses to expand such programs and opportunities.</p>",
    "q3":"There is no shortage of lessons to be learned from Freddie Gray, many related to the need to find solutions to economic and educational disparity in urban areas. And from all I have heard, read, watched, and personally experienced, I realize that the more things have changed in Baltimore City over the years, the more things have stayed the same.</p><p>We cannot maintain the status quo of one step forward for some, two steps back for others. We can address some of the lessons from Freddie Gray, whether it is ensuring that families have affordable, healthy places to live or that children have appropriate public or charter school educations, or that there be more jobs and job training. </p><p>And we must be practical about what can succeed in the short-term versus more systemic issues that can take years to change. Ultimately, we must ensure that every resident in the city is of equal concern in the eyes of government, and we must invest more efforts, energy and resources to help some neighborhoods, kids and schools catch up to others.</p><p>We know that perception is reality, and changing the public's perception towards the city leadership (as well as the police and any \"authority\") is critical. With expected changes on the city council this year, I believe we have an opportunity to instill greater hope and optimism into Baltimore City, subsequently leading towards greater collaboration that translates into outcomes and results that are badly needed.</p>",
    "q4":"In my district, high property taxes drive families a few blocks to the county (and other families don't buy in the city. I support tax break legislation for firefighters or police officers because of the potential positive impact on the city, but we have to find broader solutions to help all local residents who face high property taxes. Tax cuts can't come at the expense of residents, by raising other taxes or fees to make up the shortfall. </p><p>I believe in short-term tax breaks for long-term benefits, so am open towards plans that offer tax benefits in exchange for enhancing city development. But it must be on a case by case basis, with analysis that realistically forecasts the financial long-term benefits for the city. For projects like Harbor Point, it is too early gauge success. I believe usually such projects can help the city, but we must plan to offer benefits to nearby communities that may not directly benefit from the broader project. </p><p>We should thoroughly review the city budget and audit agencies annually. We must explore what has successfully worked in other cities (lowering taxes and cutting the budget, without reducing important city services). There are technologies today that can reduce city costs, and we should explore them while we consider cutting property taxes or raising fees. </p><p>Government officials must realize that the citizens of Baltimore are our customers. As a business owner, I know it is cheaper to keep a customer happy than to get a new customer. </p>",
    "q5":"Programs such as Vacants to Value have benefits for Baltimore City, although we must realize that there are other non-housing changes that have to occur in the City to reap the greatest benefits from housing programs. As we move forward with such projects, we should consider recommendations from non-partial organizations, such as the Abell Foundation, which outline very specific efforts that to undertake. And there must be a long-term plan, for projects such as the Governor's, to ensure that the short-term enthusiasm does not wane if progress is slow, and that there is funding to ensure maintenance of such programs beyond the first few years.</p><p>In neighborhoods away from the waterfront, we have to create natural, green areas – including parks, which have been proven to help distressed areas. We need to ensure there is funding for maintenance and upkeep of those areas, which have benefits beyond beautifying an area; green areas can play a role in preventing obesity and asthma. </p><p>Baltimore must provide and expand financial assistance to encourage commercial revitalization, working closely with the business sector to attract companies and provide jobs, while working with educational institutions to ensure job training and educational programs for those jobs. </p><p>In particular, we should duplicate successful programs from other cities. Baltimore has to recruit and engage anchor institutions, and generate buy-in partners. Looking towards long-term success, we should focus on green jobs, and recruit, fund and support such companies that will invest in a long-term commitment to non-waterfront urban neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q6":"Baltimore City's economic development is dependent on human and non-human resources, including skilled workers, education, funding, transportation, and government policies. While Baltimore has seen a recent growth in the hotel and leisure industry (partially due to the casino and general tourist industry), that will not replace job loss, such as manufacturing or Fortune 500 companies.</p><p>Barriers to the economic development in Baltimore City includes crime and taxes, which are addressed separately in this questionnaire and which need legislative initiatives to help. Education is critical too. At the high school level, we must provide greater opportunities for students to learn skills and trade before completing 12th grade. And we must expand and develop job training programs, as well as internships and apprenticeships for local residents. We should work closely with corporations as well as the large number of colleges and universities in the greater Baltimore region to ensure that local college students are receiving training and recruitment to stay in Baltimore. </p><p>We must invest Baltimore City resources in industries that have long-term opportunities for our city, particularly green job creation, and focus on implementing job growth strategic plans – recruiting companies, training workers, etc. </p><p>Moreover, Baltimore has a growing immigrant population, and we must work to attract investors and immigrants who can fund opportunities for this population. The federal government has programs in place to attract foreign capital (foreign investors or individuals with wealth), who can create opportunities; we must explore such options.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore City's government structure gives significantly more power to the mayor, and I believe that there needs to be greater balance of power with the city council. Having single council districts should enable residents to have a strong voice on the city council, but it is insufficient, and we need to ensure proper representation of the local citizens and their needs. For that reason, I support efforts such as changing the number of votes needed to override the mayor's veto, effectively ensuring a greater balance between the executive and the council. </p><p>And while I believe that it is appropriate for the mayor to sit on the Board of Estimates, the mayor should not have as much power over that board as currently exists (with the mayor essentially in control of 3 of the 5 votes of the Board). The structure of the Board of Estimates is in dire need of changing.</p><p>I also believe that the city councilmembers do not have sufficient say in the budget. Particularly now, as we prepare for significant changes on the City Council and a new mayor, it is worthwhile to consider an in-depth review of the budget and a financial overhaul of the city. With regards to the council members not permitted to increase or add new items to the budget, we should be exploring whether that is in the city's best interest, or if we should change the current system. </p>",
    "q8":"I do believe that the current council has been concerned with some of the key priorities – trying to revitalize Baltimore and making it a better place to raise families. While the city budget in recent years included funding that would help in the fight against crime, better education, affordable housing, and creating a stronger fiscal environment, the city council did not do enough to implement the programs or create effective solutions. And for some of the better legislation, the implementation was not carried out well, or insufficient foresight was involved. </p><p>So while creating legislation, for example against panhandling, to improve the city, we should have solid legislation and implementation abilities to help our homeless get back on their feet or get proper mental and physical health care as we remove them from the streets they are familiar with. Another example of the right ideas but improper execution was the speed camera fiasco. We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to get out of a contract that sold us faulty technology. And putting ads on fire trucks to prevent closure of fire stations is a band-aid approach, and does not get to the root of solving the budget crisis in Baltimore.</p>",
    "q9":"A recent failure was the 2016 blizzard. We anticipated it, but were insufficiently prepared. Local residents and businesses who could not get down their streets due to lack of clear roads were threatened with fines for not shoveling their sidewalks. The city wasn't adequately aware of what streets weren't plowed. And outside vendors are billing the city for millions of dollars and we haven't verified that the work was done properly. </p><p>City services have improved in recent years, but there are areas still lacking, such as lower levels of crime. The response time to a break-in, for example, is unacceptable. While we understand there are limited resources and the police are dealing with more serious crimes, the public must feel secure in their homes.</p><p>For non-emergency services, technology has enabled tremendous improvements; as technology advances and the city's population hopefully grows, we must ensure that our government is one step ahead – being proactive instead of waiting for the public to complain. Proper delivery of city services is a combination of management (including upgraded technology) and funding, and Baltimore City must prioritize both. </p><p>Many well-intentioned initiatives in the city have been put forward without proper planning and have tremendously lacked execution.</p><p>As an entrepreneur, I understand the need to review all aspects of every project and factor a cost-benefit analysis in conjunction with a throughout viability study. As a council member, I will protect the taxpayers' investments like I protect my own business investments for greater outcomes for Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q10":"As a local community activist and leader in Baltimore City's northwest area, I've had a front-row seat to seeing the challenges facing our community, and I have sought out solutions. For example, I learned that our city has a federally-funded summer meal program for children that has existed for many years, which expands the hot lunch school program, giving nutritious, free meals to local children. An entire segment of the district was not getting this program, which should have been available to them. I worked closely with government officials and was able to feed thousands of more local children daily.</p><p>Having a political outsider on the council – someone who runs a business while serving as a community leader – provides us that hybrid leadership we need to see and approach things from a different perspective than people who have been in government for years and have been part of the status quo.</p><p>With Baltimore City about to enter a new political era, we need a city council that can infuse bold, new ideas into the city. I am a life-long resident of the city and of the 5th Council District, and because I love the city and know it can be a great place to live and work, I have chosen to raise my family here. But coming from outside of city government, I can look at things from a different lens and improve the city, beyond the communities and neighborhoods I have been actively and effectively helping until now.</p>"

I will continue to be addressing these issues through additional outreach/partnerships/forums with organizations, faith based, businesses, schools/youth, local hospital/clinics, and police department. The \"Park Heights Safe Streets\" program has been very effective in its designated area, and I would work to keep and extend boundaries. \"Food deserts\" have begun to be addressed in the District, with the opening of Shop Rite,Save-A-Lot grocery stores, and urban gardens/festivals. I will continue to encourage building on successful urban agricultural community partnership projects, such as, the Callaway Garrison, Ashburton, and Baltimore Orchard Project which has been dedicated to improving the health of the neighborhood apple tree orchard, (located on median of Callaway Avenue). Continue access to job training programs, such as JARC, Coding, and GED completion. Continuing housing development efforts(rental/affordable permanent), such as the renovated Pangea Apartments, Dorothy J Apartments, and the new Renaissance Gardens Apartments for seniors only. Continue \"Healthy Neighborhoods\" Housing Homeownership Initiatives.

Continue support of the Zeta Center, Z-HAP Healthy Living program which has expanded to a Senior Public Housing facility.</p>",
    "q2":"Much work needs to be done. The Commissioner and Officers are beginning to develop strong relationships in neighborhoods, focusing on high violence street blocks, corners and clusters of addresses within hot spots, especially where there is gang activity. Helping to create a climate of inclusiveness between the Police Department and Communities are extremely vital. It begins with engaging the community to develop trust and respect on All levels. Police executing best practices, and strategic early childhood in-school and after-school activities, with our youth are a must. Strengthening of police community relations councils, Civilian Review Board, COP programs, etc., and police officers attending community association meetings, on a consistent bases is important. Consistent training for Supervisors and Officers, reprimand and firing for misconduct of officers and leaders not following Local, State, Federal policies, rules, laws, and procedures which can make a difference. We need treatment plans that involves the family and community . The focus needs to be on preventing the conditions that draw people into violent or criminal behavior.</p>",
    "q3":"It brought attention to how we must All confront the issues and barriers of urban poverty and social-economic inequality within the communities in Baltimore City, and throughout individual Districts. Schools play a critical role and must address the need of job readiness skills implementation, before, high school graduation. This includes adding pre-apprenticeship programs, internships, structured coursework in conflict resolution, self-confidence, responsibility, dressing appropriately, leadership, volunteerism in communities, resources to apply for jobs, increased support services, and better adult, and peer to peer outside activities, just to name a few.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes- Finding creative ways to attract businesses and new residents to Baltimore in a way that the entire City can benefit. Need visionary ideas to fill many of the City's vacant homes and at the same time helping our most disadvantaged population. Economic development is a huge business. Its important for the developer to build trust and plan to build an open communication with surrounding community associations and residents so that plans do not drive out lower-income people and result in complete gentrification. Inclusionary housing should be brought to the discussions.</p>",
    "q5":"The entire 6th District is away from the waterfront and major revitalization efforts have been continuing for many years in the District. Many of the tenants and homeowners continue to use much of their salaries on housing costs. That's why now, its so important to put focus on permanent affordable housing options. Baltimore should continue it's greening strategies ranging from urban farming,repairing community parks, and planning building of green certified properties. Demolition and acquisition should continue but, implementation of human service needs of residents that have built a vested interest for many years in the community, must continue to be provided with access to schools, goods and services, community centers,etc. While there is more work to do, progress continues, as long as there are combined partnerships with the City agencies, Community,Businesses, Faith based, Schools,etc.</p>",
    "q6":"Barriers- having a lack of qualified job readiness training/skills, and chronic financial instability. Address by encouraging extensive ties to organizations that could provide training, apprenticeship training, provide other services to residents, like on-site job centers, to help them advance along career pathways with a decent living wage.This includes at-risk youth, incarceration, youth who have not graduated high school, or adults who have experienced homelessness. Also, support raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.</p>",

As, a member of committees such as, the Land Use and Transportation Committee, working on the Transform Baltimore Zoning re-writes, and Chairperson of Urban Affairs and Aging approving urban renewal plans, I have a chance to express concerns effecting communities, especially suggested changes within the last 40 years. This is one balancing effort attempt. But truly not enough. Today's power is still Mayoral driven. One consideration I have been studying, would be to equalize voting power on the Board of Estimates. Communication is the key between both forms of government (Administrative and Legislative) at all times.</p>",
    "q8":"Yes, within limitations of power. Public Safety; such as, efforts for implementation of the body camera program, police brutality concerns and awareness, tracking police overtime spending. Education; such as quarterly reviews of 21st Century Schools funding/closures, successful restoring of State funding for Senior Centers and awareness of their formula change, the Youth Works awareness/hiring of more youth for summer program initiative, legalization of same sex marriage, imposing curfews and creating of curfew centers for youth. Transform Baltimore Zoning Code; continue rewrites and amendment implementation for communities, Health Disparities; increased enforcement or closures of food establishments not in compliance. Many investigative hearings; from strengthening utility/water bill assistance, homelessness population concerns, city agency process and audits on a regular bases, proper implementation of \"smart meters\", TIF's or subsides granted such as,Harbor Point project. Code enforcement on advertising of drug paraphernalia in windows of businesses; Businesses required to hire a percentage of Baltimore City residents / minorities on contracts; Employee Pension System and government agency privatization issues.</p>",
    "q9":"A need for better communications outreach and a follow-up plan for services to assist.

    "q1":"The most pressing issues in my district are public safety, jobs and education. In the area of public safety we will work to keep our communities safe through enhanced crime prevention efforts that include:</p><p>- Community-police partnerships</p><p>- Improved emergency response</p><p>- Upgraded lighting</p><p>- Strategic installation of cameras and</p><p>- Targeted code enforcement and blight removal to eliminate environments that attract illegal activity.</p><p>But crime prevention cannot be addressed by law enforcement alone, we must implement pre-booking diversion programs as an alternative for minor drug arrests, in order to connect offenders with treatment, employment and housing services.</p><p>In the area of job creation, we must:</p><p>- Provide financial incentives for businesses that locate, hire, or expand in underserved areas.</p><p>- Identify and create financial incentives to support the development of small business and entrepreneurs.</p><p>- Create development opportunities to attract investment, especially in the areas of information technology, health sciences and innovation.</p><p>- Promote and expand employment training in information technology, health and bioscience, and advanced manufacturing.</p><p>And most importantly in the area of education we must:</p><p>- Support each school in its efforts to become a Community School that promotes student achievement, positive conditions for learning, and the overall well-being of families and communities.</p><p>- Work with principals and administrators to identify financial, technical and human capital resources to improve academics, enrichment activities, health care and social supports, family engagement and youth and community development in each school.</p><p>- Expand technology-based education opportunities for youth in schools, libraries, and community-based programs.</p><p>- Expand art programs in the schools and community.</p>",
    "q2":"By emphasizing community-police partnerships and focusing on targeting the most violent offenders, I believe that Baltimore is taking the proper steps to address violence in our communities. Commissioner Davis is experienced, has a track record of results and has earned the respect and trust of the officers that serve our communities every day.</p><p>But while I believe that the enforcement of the law is a Police function, crime prevention is everyone's responsibility. So whether we work in economic development, education, health, recreation, or even the faith community all of our collective efforts have the potential to promote a safer and more vibrant community.</p><p>Many residents long for the days when you knew the officer that worked in your neighborhood and that's not just out of a sense of nostalgia. We have to reintegrate the officer as a vital resource in the community. Part of that is the strategic deployment of police cadets once they leave the academy. In many cases these officers should be utilized in our commercial corridors, transit hubs, and other areas where residents are prevented from accessing services and patronizing businesses because of drug dealing and other illegal activities. In addition we need to support and expand programs like the Police Explorers that promote positive interactions and relationships with officers and youth.</p>",
    "q3":"It goes without saying that the death of Freddie Gray was a tragedy and the subsequent protest and unrest have in a real way awakened this city and the nation to the many disparities that exist in urban centers throughout our country. No one in their right mind would have hoped for the events of last April, but there is no denying that they occurred. And because they occurred we have now been afforded the opportunity to address community and police relationships, economic inclusion, education, health and housing inequalities with a renewed commitment to identify resources, support best practices, develop initiatives, redefine our sense of community and to be intentional in our desire to elevate all Baltimoreans and all neighborhoods. What we do with this opportunity and how we reposition our city is not only critical to Baltimore but will have national ramifications.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore's property tax rate, which is double that of any other of the surrounding counties in the State, remains a significant impediment to the attraction of residents and businesses to the city. Identifying strategies for reducing the property tax rate must be a priority. Of course that's easier said than done, because the reduction must be done in a way that doesn't jeopardize the provision of essential city services. The tax rate must be reduced incrementally to limit the impact on the delivery of those services but also in a predictable manner so that property owners have confidence that their property taxes will be going down.</p><p>There is no quick remedy to solving the tax burden that homeowner's face in the city, outside of increasing the city's tax base. Therefore the city should be diligent in identifying job-creating, revenue-increasing development opportunities throughout the city. TIFs and PILOTs when used appropriately can be effective tools to achieve that goal. Often when discussing TIFs many are quick to paint them in a negative light, when in fact many of our neighborhoods could benefit from them. I was fortune to be the lead on the redevelopment of Mondawmin Mall in West Baltimore. If not for a $15 million TIF, that $80 million redevelopment would not have been possible. No Target (first in the city), no new supermarket (largest in the city at the time) or other retailers, and none of the hundreds of jobs that were created as a result. </p>",
    "q5":"Although challenging, there are a variety of tools the city can use to encourage development in areas away from the waterfront. There are tools like the Enterprise Zone and the Enterprise Zone Focus Area Tax Credit that can be used for commercial redevelopment. Historic Tax Credits and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit can be used for residential development. In addition TIFs have proven to be very effective as exemplified with the redevelopment of Mondawmin Mall. Having leadership, even at the Council level, that understands these tools and their application is critical to revitalizing our neighborhoods.</p><p>Identifying financial resources is only part of the equation when it comes to revitalizing neighborhoods. True neighborhood revitalization also means creating sustainable communities that are safe, affordable, and inclusive. For example city-owned vacant lots can be turned into community managed open space or community gardens. Programs that provide financial assistance to homeowners to rehab their homes should be promoted and even expanded. Resources that would allow seniors to retrofit their homes and age in place should be identified. Funding for commercial façade improvement grants should be increased. </p><p>But in many of our communities even before we can promote any of these efforts we have to manage the number of vacant properties that blight our neighborhoods. Vacants to Value offers a strategy for the targeted demolition of these nuisance properties, rehabilitation of key buildings and the creation of development clusters. The resources provided by Governor Hogan will allow those efforts to impact more neighborhoods. </p>",
    "q6":"In many communities throughout the city the chief barrier to economic development and job creation is crime. Public safety is the major impediment to creating an environment for investment and attracting businesses and firms to certain areas. In order to increase the economic vitality of our neighborhoods we must steadily and significantly reduce the crime. Some of the many strategies to achieve that goal are to promote public safety through enhanced crime prevention efforts (community-police partnerships, upgraded lighting and installation of cameras) and improved emergency response. As well as developing and implementing pre-booking diversion programs as an alternative for minor drug arrests, in order to connect offenders with treatment, employment and housing services.</p>",
    "q7":"There is no debate that Baltimore's current governance structure is heavily tilted toward the Mayor, a fact that merits more exploration. But the fact that this is the case does not mean that the City Council cannot be effective and impactful in fulfilling its role to constituents throughout the city. I would be leery of rushing into any changes of the current system.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe that it's up to each Council and each Councilmember to determine what issues are of most significance to them. As the representative for the 7th District my focus would be on economic development, job creation, maintaining safe and affordable housing, public safety and improving educational opportunities for all youth.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe that in any business or agency whether they be private or public there is always opportunity for improvement. So it is important that each city service be evaluated to make certain that residents are receiving the highest quality of service and that incentives be created for exemplary service.</p>",
    "q10":"I have been blessed to work in local city government for the past 20 years. In 1996 I started as a Council Assistant in Councilman Keiffer Mitchell's Office. It was there where I first discovered my passion for public service. Eventually serving as his chief of staff, I transitioned to the Baltimore Development Corporation in 2005, where I served as a Senior Development Officer for West Baltimore. While there I was the project manager for over $700 million dollars of development including the redevelopment of Mondawmin Mall and the Horseshoe Casino. I was directly involved in the opening of eight supermarkets in food deserts throughout the city. In 2014 I accepted a position on the Mayor's staff, where I currently serve as the Assistant Deputy Mayor for Economic and Neighborhood Development. At each stop I have always been and remain committed to helping to improve communities throughout the city.</p><p>The civil unrest of last April has done nothing but strengthen my resolve to serve. The challenges that we face are diverse and this is truly a critical time in the life of our city, but I believe that over the past 20 years I have exemplified the commitment, the passion and the insight necessary to affect positive change in the 7th District.</p>"

There are areas in the 7th district are labled \"hot spots\". However, the citizens don't know that they live in a area that holds such a label. The constitutional rights which are afforded to more affluent neighborhoods in this city are non exsistent in the 7th. There must be more community policing . I'm a firm believer that one should live in the city that they police. The city of Boston is a perfect example of how it can be done. We are located in a food dessert. We must attract afforable super markets. The practice of over charging is not acceptable.</p>",

    "q3":"When you ignore a certain segment of any city protest and unrest is what you will get.That this city must address the tales of 2 cities. When you have citizens who feel that their voices aren't being heard they find other ways to garner attention. All the stakeholders in this city want the samethings. We can not continue to focus on the waterfront . This city is larger than that.</p>",

I would continue the grassroots fight for a $15/hr living wage being implemented to raise working people out of poverty. I would also push for a \"jobs for all\" program by increasing public sector jobs to build crumbling infrastructure and communities. We must also prioritize economic development outside of areas like downtown Baltimore, Harbor East and Canton and push for development projects in East and West Baltimore that do not push out Black and poor residents but instead allows them to stay in affordable housing and enjoy the benefits of the development.</P>",
   "q2": "<p>The current leadership of Baltimore has placed a great deal of the burden of ending crime on the police. The police will not be able to succeed in reducing crime without the use of profiling tactics that criminalize whole communities and continue to strain police-community relations. The issues which lead to crime are related to poverty, educational failure, drug addiction and lack of jobs. There must be commitment by the local government to address the underlining systemic issues which cause crime. We must treat drug addiction as a serious public health crisis and use the correct resources to treat those who suffer from drug addiction, not just the police. The police department must be more accountable to the communities they serve. The police department will have to work to improve their response time to all communities equally, work to show respect to all its citizens and be held accountable to the citizens of Baltimore via a strong citizen review board with elected members who have investigative, subpoena and indictment powers.</p>",
   "q3": "<p>Riots are the voices of the unheard. Many Black, poor and disenfranchised citizens are extremely frustrated with the lack of progress and economic development in their communities. If political and economic leadership want to regain the confidence of these communities there must be a commitment to changing the policy decisions that have gotten us to this point. City leadership must be willing to listen to the life and death concerns of people in the areas impacted by the unrest and work hard to implement strategies that will correct our current path of development.</p>",
   "q4": "<p>Baltimore should reduce the property tax rate. Additional property tax rate reduction should be made for seniors and veterans. I do not support PILOT and other similar incentives for development in downtown Baltimore area. Developers and corporations must begin to pay their fair share of taxes, property and corporate income taxes. The resources we can recoup from currently favored business forces must be put to work do implement development projects in blighted communities.</p>",
   "q5": "<p>We must prioritize economic development in long neglected communities outside of downtown. Programs like Vacants to Value and PILOT must be made more accessible to small, local developers who are vested in the communities the projects will be carried out. Governor Hogan's announcement does not go far enough in dealing with the underlining issues of blight. There must be a commitment to ensure that all the jobs created to demolish the blight homes go to residents in the city and especially district 7. Also I do not agree with the Governor's proposal that the green spaces created by removing the blighted homes should be made available to speculators and large developers. Instead, we city leadership must demand that affordable housing be put in its place so that people in the neglected areas can benefit from the development.</p>",
   "q6": "<p>Economic development decisions have been the major reason we see poverty in the places they currently exist. City leadership has placed its support for developers and projects that do serve the interest of the majority of city residents. We must prioritize jobs which rebuild the aging infrastructure, build homes and make life in Baltimore more livable for all its citizens. This approach in combination with implementing a living wage law in the city would create a more democratic economic development strategy throughout the city.</p>",
   "q7": "<p>I believe there is a balance of power between the mayor and the city council. However, the lack of major difference in policy and strategy between the mayor and the city council has to be changed. The city political leadership has to be shaken out of it lull and be forced to address the economic, social and political demands of working class and poor residents.</p>",
   "q8": "<p>The city council has failed to focus on the right issues in my opinion. It has made the wrong decision when it comes to economic development, it has made the wrong decision with the closing of recreations centers, it made the wrong decision to not intervene on behalf of the citizens of Baltimore when it comes to school closing, electricity rate hikes and police accountability.</p>",
   "q9": "<p>With this season's blizzard, many people were again let down by the city and left trapped in their neighborhoods. Also communities struggle to get timely assistance from the police to deal with complaints, from inspectors to deal with accumulated trash and unkept properties. Feedback from citizens on key city services needs to be collected and responded to on an annual bases. The city must also make resources available for communities to help themselves. Many communities take the initiative to do what they can do solve issues in their communities; they need a local government that is supportive of these indigenous initiatives.</p>",

    "q1":"Unemployment is the most pressing issue in the district., As Father Greg of Homeboy Industries said, \"only a job can stop a bullet\". The distress and crime rate in the 8th can be lowered with proper attention to creating more jobs. We can create more opportunities by forging partnerships woith unions that represent carpenters, plumbers, electricians, welders, etc. and train and mentor candidates through their apprenticeships ensuring full employment at a significant wage.</p><p>The crime rate in the eighth can be addressed at the same time time with laser like attention on repeat offenders who are not willing or able to go to work. The drug trade is emblematic of a failed public policy that makes criminals of many men who are earning money for their families.We must find other avenues for them to find work and start to learn a work ethic that will allow them to work for the rest of their lives. </p><p>We must also help them rediscover the hope that they once had so they can see a future themselves. This can only be done when they are able to work and feed themselves and their children.</p>",
    "q2":"Crime is a significant factor in not only the communities because of the the drug trade but because citizens believe that it is victimless. But it ravages communities. </p><p>The police department must focus on the worst criminals; we have heard this strategy bandies about in the city for some time. It must be vigorously implemented. This can only be done if citizens feel that their concerns are addressed.</p><p>I would establish a dedicated line and track the calls and responses of the police department to the concerts of my constituents. Although they use citistat; it can only be tracked if the complaints or concerns or reports of criminal activity are actually recorded. This would allow us to have accountability for the actions and reactions to the calls of the citizens of the eighth district. It would also allow me to have actual facts to report or question the response of the police in our district. </p><p>We couild then have community meetings to discuss the responsiveness of the police, the issues that are continue to plague the community. This will enable a discourse to happen that is not happening now. There is a lot of finger pointing and recriminations that are going on for both sides. This will help create trust and a fruitful dialogue between the community and the police department.</p>",
    "q3":"I believe that the death of Freddie Gray was unfortunate and should never have happened if the protocols of the police department had been followed as outlined in the general orders.</p><p>The looting of the drug stores and businesses was attributable to a small proportionate criminal element that was taking advantage of the unrest.</p><p>The unrest in and of itself was a symptom of the underlying anger and disenfranchisement that has been felt in the black community for a significantly long time.</p><p>The black community has felt ignored, irrelevant and powerless to change its circumstances in the city. The black community has a high unemployment rate, high crime rate, and a feeling that no one is listening.</p><p>The response to the unrest has been underwhelming. Everyone wants to pour money in the neighborhoods through the same conduits that got us to the riots. The same people will be making the decisions about what will happen in the neighborhoods. In ten years those same people will remain and we will be back where we are today.</p><p>The people from the community who were interviewed after the riots were talking about jobs, getting to work and providing for their families. </p><p>A year later the lessons have not been learned. The communities are happy that the pharmacies are coming back on line, that there is a stronger police presence and policing strategy is focused.</p><p>But it has not resulted in a reduction in the unemployment rate. We still have not heard the voices.</p>",
    "q4":"I don't believe that the property tax rate is a significant hindrance. People still want to live in the city and be close to the activities that are offered. However, most of the people that taking advantage of the amenities are young and single. We lose most of population because they do not view the city as a place to raise a family. That means that we must focus our efforts on improving the school system.</p><p>I believe that TIF's should only be used when a developer has a project with significant public interest and that the project has an overwhelming benefit to the community and or the city. TIF's should not be used for projects that are generally profitable and would only be used to increase the margins. I would define significant public interest a, but not limited to a low income or mixed income housing project that would not move forward without public funds, a development that is in a part of Baltimore that has seen significant disinvestment.</p><p>TIF's should be used when a project will not be developed but for the public investment.</p>",
    "q5":"In the eighth district which should be considered a gateway to the city there is a compelling interest to move projects like Uplands forward as fast as possible. The development of a business incubator on the west side along Edmondson Avenue to help spur development. A gateway development at Edmondson and Franklin especially with the abadonment of the red line. A number of small developers already have investments in these areas. It would be a great time to tap in to these resources and develop a long term plan for the development of Edmondson (rte 40) that would get people to stop and get something as simple as a cup of coffee.</p><p>Vacants to value and the governor's proposed demolition plan will go a long way to help alleviate the view that we are dilapidated, poor and old metropolitan city. </p>",
    "q6":"The single most important barrier to job creation is the inability of our school system to properly educate our children. The basics of education are reading and math. You cannot write code for a computer, repair a car, or be a carpenter .if you cannot read or do simple math.</p><p>I believe that we have ensure that they are educated properly.</p><p>Absent the faith in our school system at this time we must forge alliances with business and unions to foster training programs that will allow are citizens to apply and keep entry level positions with a promising outlook for the future. This means getting teller positions at banks, apprenticeship programs in the trades, learning to operate heavy euipment or learning how to weld. There are many trades that you can learn and do without a college degree. In most cases you can earn more than you would with a college degree.</p><p>We can teach and train our teenagers that there is a compelling reason to stay in school even if you do not go to college. There are many opportunities for you in the job market.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe the balance of power is fine. The Bolton change that I woulkd like to see would be the Board of Estimates. I would like to see that reduced to three members; Mayor, Comptroller and City Council President.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe the city council has passed or considered a lot of \"feel good legislation\". Ban the box, dirt bike park, etc are all reactionary and really do not change anything.</p><p>The ban the box although a good idea on it face does not change the fact that public records still go back beyond seven years for a background check. I can see what you did twenty years ago and not hire you regardless of your conduct since the incident..</p><p>The Transform Baltimore-rezoning effort although not passed yet will make a significant difference for small businesses and neighborhoods moving forward.</p><p>I would like to see legislation that limits the time a business can research a potential applicants background and criminal history with the exception of violence or theft.</p><p>I would like to city the city councils sponsor, pass and work to pass legislation to change the board of estimates, change the school board to an elected school board and limit the board of estimates to elected officials only.</p>",
    "q9":"The most significant issue is response to issues that citizens. The 311 operators must have more information especially during emergencies i.e. snow storms, flooding etc. They should be given access or have information on when streets are plowed, streets will be cleared etc.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for city council because I believe there should be a stronger focus on training and job creation to help alleviate the significantly high unemployment rate among men between the ages of 19 and 30.</p>"

    "q1":"After years of working alongside several neighborhood improvement associations and personally visiting over 6,000 homes throughout every neighborhood in the 8th District, I have gained a deep understanding of the issues impacting residents. The most pressing issues that residents have shared with me along this journey are a need for greater access to employment opportunities that pay family-supporting wages, enriching afterschool programing for our youth, and an end to the violence that has devastated families and communities throughout our City. </p><p>To address the issue of un-and underemployment, I believe we must leverage funding to support businesses and initiatives that prioritize the training and hiring of hard to employ area residents, such as adults without a GED or HS equivalent, a criminal record, and little if any work experience. I will work with labor unions and community-based workforce development programs, making sure that they prioritize recruitment of and service to residents in our neighborhoods. </p><p>Additionally, I will engage citywide stakeholders to ensure our residents have access to entrepreneurship training and mentorship opportunities, start-up capital, and other resources to help them successfully launch and sustain more community-rooted and community-owned enterprises.</p><p>To empower our youth, I would work to provide resources for community-based afterschool initiatives that attract and engage them in fun, technology-centered, academically enriching activities. Also, I believe that putting an end to the violence that is devastating our neighborhoods and ensure our youth live productive and fulfilling lives, we must support community-based mediation and mentorship initiatives and fully fund youth-job programs. </p>",
    "q2":"Recently developed programs that have been implemented by the Baltimore City Heath and Police Departments, which utilize community-building strategies to reduce violence in our neighborhoods are a step in the right direction. I believe that efforts to engage directly with our youth and work to empower community leaders to be change agents are most effective in transforming our neighborhoods. </p><p>Though, I would advocate for increased financial support for the capacity building of community-led and managed organizations; as they've been proven to be more sustainable over time and more likely to build trust in neighborhoods where relationships between law enforcement and residents are deeply strained. </p><p>Additionally, I believe that we must begin to view gun violence as a public health crisis and address the underlying issues that lead to violence—which cannot be resolved by the criminal justice system's overreliance on mass incarceration. Rather, it requires a commitment to treating drug addiction, mental health interventions, and reinvesting in public housing to eliminate the disturbing prevalence of lead poisoning among Black youth.</p><p>To improve police-community relations, I believe it's crucial that significant policy changes be implemented to hold bad law enforcement officers accountable for their actions. Recent efforts to implement community-policing strategies by the Baltimore City Police Department will only be affective if communities and law enforcement officers can develop constructive relationships rooted in trust, transparency, and mutual accountability. Additionally, I support the establishment of partnerships with community-based organizations to implement officer re-training focused on the use of de-escalation techniques and mediation. </p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray and the unrest that followed brought to the forefront the fractured relationship between communities of color and law enforcement in Baltimore City. Furthermore, this was compounded by deep frustration with the historic disinvestment and neglect of low-income neighborhoods, schools, and housing in the very communities that need it most. </p><p>What became evident after reflecting on what occurred was the need to address the socioeconomic disparities that exist between what many consider the \"Two Baltimore's\". One is flush with economic opportunity and where public investment is bountiful and the other economically deprived for generations. Tragically, the boundaries of these \"Two Baltimore's\" were drawn on redlining maps during the era of Jim Crow and have persisted since. </p><p>But, out of the tragedy that occurred last April, has come a renewed since of urgency to have honest dialogues about the structural inequities that exist and to push our public officials to make real changes to address issues of inadequate housing, underfunded classrooms, a lack of living wage jobs, and an end to mass incarceration. While tensions between residents and law enforcement were the clear symptoms of the problem, it's going to take a lot more than the police department to deal with the actual causes of the problem. I look forward to working alongside neighborhood residents, community advocates, and other public officials on the front lines to address these issues. </p>",
    "q4":"As a homeowner in West Baltimore, I would certainly appreciate a tax reduction but given the current state of the city and the needs of our communities, I would not support a reduction of the property tax rate at this time. I expect the city to be fiscally responsible and transparent in how it uses those tax revenues, which is where there is a missed opportunity with audits. Many homeowners have shared with me deep frustration with the lack of transparency on how the taxes are being spent. </p><p>Nearly fifty percent of the city's general fund revenue is generated by property taxes and significant cuts would likely result in a negative impact on city services. I believe that work needs to be done to grow our tax base, which starts with making our neighborhoods stronger and safer, eliminating blight, and improving our public schools—all of which will draw families back into the city and encourage renters to seek a pathway to homeownership. </p><p>I believe that the frequent use of tax subsidies to fund development projects has been problematic for Baltimore City. Many of these deals have gone through without seeing if public funds were really supporting public benefit. Just this year Baltimore City Public Schools received a severe cut to funding from the State due to an increase in citywide property value assessments. This deeply impacts our ability to adequately educate our youth and provide them with the resources they need to succeed—jeopardizing the future of our city. </p>",
    "q5":"I would support implementing a vacant property tax to discourage speculation by investors and to encourage and incentivize homeownership. There are an estimated 30,000 vacant properties throughout Baltimore City, of which, the vast majority are privately owned and severely neglected. Owners don't pay their fair share of property taxes due to having lower assessments than homeowners who do invest in the upkeep of their homes. </p><p>Also, I would advocate for and assist in the development of community land trusts to transform vacant properties into better community use—more recreational-use, greenspace, and community-controlled affordable housing. Additionally, CLTs provide an opportunity to create employment opportunities for local residents who can be trained to demolish and/or renovate blighted properties. </p><p>Additionally, I believe that we must begin to prioritize the use of transit-oriented development to encourage the revitalizing of commercial corridors that are away from the waterfront. Targeted redevelopment incentives for these areas will provide resources to small businesses to modernize their properties and grow their customer base by encouraging commuters along major roadways and public-transit routes to patronize their stores and thus grow the local economy. </p><p>Regarding the Vacants-to-Value initiative and the Governors recently announced increase in funding available for demolition and incentives for new housing development, I believe more can and should be done to engage city residents in the planning and implementation process. Both programs have serious barriers to entry for city residents to have a seat at the table and share their vision in the redevelopment of their own neighborhoods. </p>",
    "q6":"Baltimore City has long been impacted by a lack of economic opportunity, fueled not only by global trends out of our control and by poor policy decisions locally, but also, by a growing skills gap between what is required to fill job opportunities in emerging high skill and high wage fields. Areas like construction, health care and technology development are areas that we need to focus on closing this gap. </p><p>I firmly believe the only way forward is to increase investment in labor and community-based apprenticeship programs, community college, adult education programs, and workforce development/readiness organizations. Additionally, more support is needed for organizations that assist returning-citizens with skills development and criminal record expungement. </p><p>Though, it doesn't matter how many jobs you create if city residents can't get to them. Too many of our neighborhoods lack strong transit choices that can connect our transit-dependent households, and attract neighborhood investment. My vision for transportation in Baltimore is to push for a system that reduces the time it takes for residents to get to work and school and which connects regionally to expand access to well-paying employment opportunities across the region. </p><p>Finally, both national and local data and research overwhelmingly show us that the majority of job opportunities come from small and mid-size businesses. But many have challenges thriving due to our lack of small-business incubation and have difficulty navigating the regulations necessary to get started. </p>",
    "q7":"I believe that the City Council has a tremendous amount of power to counterbalance the influence of the Mayor's office, but has not always leveraged it in an impactful way. Though, I would still support changes in the balance of power between the City Council and the Mayor in a few key areas. </p><p>Currently, the City Council does not have enough power over the funding priorities within the city budget. The Council may reduce or eliminate budget request but cannot increase funding or add new requests. I would support allowing the Council to reallocate funding within the budget, so that the priorities of the council are reflected and advocated for. </p><p>Also, I would support reintroducing a charter amendment to strengthen the Councils veto power by allowing a two-thirds vote to override a mayoral veto. </p>",
    "q8":"I believe that there are areas that the City Council could have certainly focused more attention to make a bigger impact on our city. Our city still struggles with hiring local workers, paying livable wages on development projects, adequately addressing the issue of blight, and on eradicating the systemic inequities that contribute to violence. Also, not nearly enough has been done to address the issue of affordable housing. Too many families must balance the burden of paying for housing and affording necessities such as food, transportation, and medical care. </p><p>Though, over the last four years, I do believe the City Council has made some important changes on critical issues but could have certainly done more to make an impact. In my opinion, significant progress was made to:</p><p>- Reduce barriers for returning citizens seeking employment via legislation to \"ban the box\" on job applications. </p><p>- Despite a Mayoral veto, the council's vote for police body cameras was a step in the right direction to build trust between Baltimore Police and community residents. </p><p>- Many have stressed the need for more transparency and accountability regarding the way the city spends tax dollars, and in 2012 the City Council passed a bill to allow voters to amend the charter and require 13 city agencies to be audited every four years. </p>",
    "q9":"I believe the city could improve service by relying more on the use of open data and being transparent and accountable about city services, in order to accurately diagnose where there are challenge. The city needs to involve citizens in being a part of the solution. I have had countless discussions with residents in the 8th District about the areas of improvement they'd like to see in order to make their neighborhood stronger. </p><p>In my conversations with residents, many have expressed ideas on issues including trash, illegal dumping, vacant property maintenance, and holding landlords accountable for not maintaining their property. Many have shared ideas on how to resolve these issues but have expressed frustration with the lack of opportunity to give their feedback and input. It is important that we implement a variety of strategies to directly engage with and seek feedback from city residents on how to best meet their needs. </p><p>To improve quality and responsiveness of city services, I would advocate for an increased reliance on data to guide the allocation and ensure the efficient use of resources to address the issues in our city. There is truly a need to utilize technology to increase public engagement in service improvement and to promote transparency in how our resources are being allocated. Additionally, it is crucial to eliminate departmental silos and encourage collaboration between agencies and with the public to improve services. </p>",
    "q10":"I'm running because I firmly believe our city needs a public servant will work with them. Someone with extensive experience in working to empower residents to become the change agents needed to move our city forward. As a native Baltimorean, I have made a lifelong commitment to community organizing, fighting for good jobs that pay livable wages, and engaging with and advocating for the improvement of our neighborhoods. As one of the co-founders of Neighbors Without Borders of Greater Southwest Baltimore and the Village Farmers' Market at Edmondson-Westside High School, I have a strong track record of working with my neighbors in the 8th District and connecting them to opportunities and resources.</p>"

    "bio":"<p>Bullock, a political science professor at Towson University, ran for City Council in 2011 and placed third in a nine-way race. He holds a doctorate in government and politics from the University of Maryland, College Park.</p>",
    "q1":"Among the numerous issues to be addressed in the 9th District, jobs and housing are priorities. The 9th District has a disproportionate number of adults out of work and families living below the poverty line, so we need to create jobs as well as provide training and placement. Baltimore must emphasize workforce development in areas of expected job growth. This means creating incentives for local hiring and forming partnerships with educational institutions to provide training for careers in technology, healthcare, and green industry. We must also partner with faith-based and community organizations to secure grants for youth jobs and ex-offender re-entry programs.</p><p>The 9th District has a large amount of vacant properties which further destabilizes communities. The City must utilize available resources for demolition to clear neighborhoods of dangerous eyesores. It would also be appropriate to raise the penalties for abandoned and nuisance properties, while lowering property taxes for responsible homeowners. Baltimore should also revisit the idea of providing vacant properties at a discount to individuals and groups. Another necessary step is reducing bureaucratic red tape to create a more efficient and streamlined permitting process; this would make it easier for those seeking to rehabilitate houses.</p>",
    "q2":"We could definitely make the system more efficient by focusing less on non-violent offenders and more so on violent crime. Far too often, violent repeat offenders are back out on the streets to commit another crime. Truth in sentencing would help in this regard as those convicted would be expected to serve the time given. As a father and husband, safety is a top priority for my family.</p><p>Community oriented policing and increased foot posts could also help in this regard. It is important for officers to get out of their cars and walk neighborhoods; this would help build relationships in the community and create a certain level of trust. With these elements in place, people would be more willing to make complaints and the police would get better information -- thus helping to cut down on the many cases of no prosecution due to insufficient evidence.</p><p>As one who is raising a family in Baltimore, I want to our neighborhoods to be safe for everyone. It is also important to address the root causes of crime in our communities. To this end, we must provide more constructive recreational opportunities for young people as well as partner with locally-based companies to sponsor summer and year-round jobs. Keeping our kids in productive activities helps reduce crime and increase public safety.</p>",
    "q3":"Police officers must be trained in community policing techniques, including de-escalation. This needs to be part of a comprehensive emphasis on foot posts and neighborhood services. Cultural competency training should also be a mandatory component of introductory and ongoing education. Police officers who engage in excessive force, especially repeat offenders, need to face harsher consequences and be removed for such behavior. This should be stipulated in their employment agreements at the outset. </p><p>Additionally, the unrest speaks to underlying disparities in education, housing, and employment that have gone unaddressed in West Baltimore for years. This is particularly pronounced among many of our city's youth who have felt ignored and neglected. Therefore, we need comprehensive strategies to invest in chronically underserved communities. In the immediate aftermath, it was encouraging to see the multitude of local groups who came together to serve the community in a time of crisis. </p>",
    "q4":"Potential homebuyers make calculations about what they can afford to spend on a mortgage and taxes. In light of the high property taxes, many make the rational decision to live outside of the City where taxes are cheaper. In Baltimore City, the high tax rate prevents businesses from locating here and discourages families from purchasing homes. Therefore, the City must reduce taxes across the board, and offset the lost revenue by auditing government agencies to cut waste. It would be feasible to reduce the property tax rate by 30-35 percent over a four year period.</p><p>If Baltimore provides incentives and breaks to encourage development, a significant investment must also be made in our neighborhoods. The establishment of community benefit agreements provides an avenue for responsible development in conjunction with a targeted impact in the surrounding area. It is possible to have a double bottom line: making a profit while also providing an economic return to the people of Baltimore. </p>",
    "q5":"While the money for demolition and redevelopment is necessary, the City must ensure that communities are not left behind and have a voice in the process. Likewise, the disposition of vacant housing is critical, however there must be opportunities for smaller scale contractors and developers to participate. Some houses could be turned over to individuals and community organizations with the resources to renovate them. This would also provide job training for vocational students and make affordable homeownership a reality for neighborhood residents. </p><p>Additionally, Community Land Trusts have proven to be effective in maintaining affordable housing and taking it out of the speculative market. Also, the multitude of abandoned houses and vacant lots presents an opportunity for community gardens and urban agriculture to combat food deserts. This would not only beautify neighborhoods, but would also address health and food disparities by providing access to locally grown produce.</p>",
    "q6":"One barrier is the inability to recognize existing markets. For instance, in many neighborhoods there are no full service grocery stores; however, there are clearly potential shoppers. I believe that people should have access to a variety of amenities and services so they can patronize local establishments and keep money in the community. As a former transportation planner, I understand that a comprehensive public transit system is needed and long overdue. The proposed Redline would have connected people to jobs and services while promoting economic growth by spurring mixed-use development including housing and retail.</p><p>Another obstacle is insufficient workforce preparation. In order to spur equitable development and decent jobs, we need to incentivize investment local hiring and training. But we must also be able to connect our residents to these jobs. As economic development is central to the future of the 9th District, we must revitalize commercial corridors such as Edmondson Avenue and West Baltimore Street. This means supporting existing businesses and recruiting new ones. This is also crucial to creating local employment, which is necessary to increase the City's continually shrinking tax base.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore has an extremely strong mayor form of government. However, there are changes that could be implemented to give the City Council greater power. For instance, the number of council votes that it takes to override a mayoral veto should be reduced from the current threshold of 3/4 to 2/3, which would be in keeping with most other municipalities.</p>",
    "q8":"While the focus on audits was a step in the right direction, it did not go far enough to address systemic financial irregularities and mismanagement. There must also be increased attention on how to streamline government agency operations to make them more efficient. Also, the emphasis on funding for youth programs is something that is appropriate and must be expanded.</p>",
    "q9":"We must make the 311 system more responsive by not closing out complaints that are left unaddressed. In addition to increased communication and coordination to speed up response times, persistent complaints must be prioritized. Also, progress reports from agencies would make them more accountable to City residents.</p>",
    "q10":"My wife and I are homeowners who are raising our children here. We love Baltimore and want to see our city reach its full potential. I am determined to create a better environment for my sons to grow up in and a place where my wife and I can grow old together. I want to serve on the City Council because we need competent leadership who can articulate the interests of the community while creating effective public policy to move our neighborhoods and Baltimore City forward.</p>"

    "q1":"The most pressuring issues in my district are substance abuse, abandoned homes, lack of work ethic training, unemployment, lack of guidance and resources for the youth, the schools, pollution, and failed relationships between citizens and law enforcement. I would first research the cause of these issues, implement a strategic plan that provide information and resources that address the issues, and follow up regularly on the progress of the issues being resolved.</p>",
    "q2":"I do not have confidence in the Police Department's current leadership and do not believe that Baltimore is pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime. In order to effectively approach and resolve the issue of violent crime, you have to have an understanding of all areas of Baltimore and why and how things happen the way that they do. I would have more events and activities that promote regaining of trust and relationship building between the citizens and law enforcement. This will also allow questions to be asked, processes to be understood, and suggestions to be given that will benefit everyone as a whole.</p>",
    "q3":"The lesson I have learned is that an individuals background can have a great affect on the way he or she is treated by the justice system, which is not all the time fair. I have also learned that better resources need to be provided to the incarcerated that will effectively assist with their rehabilitation and will attempt to prevent then from being a repeat offender. Although protest have been effective in some circumstances, in most cases, other alternatives should and can be taken if you wish for your point to be taken seriously.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore should definitely reduce it's property tax rate, and can do so by providing resources and easier processes that will allow more utilization of Baltimore's abandoned properties. Although I disagree with the processes to encourage developments like Harbor Point, I understand the reason behind it. However, there are more areas that need attention and once tended to, can have a great affect on the reduction of reducing the property tax rate.</p>",
    "q5":"To encourage commercial and residential revitalization in neighborhoods away from the waterfront, Baltimore can allow not just major developers, but more non-profit organizations and potential individuals to follow necessary steps that will allow them to have ownership and be able to rehabilitate the abandoned houses and commercial properties. Vacants to Value is a very tedious process, that typically allow major developers to purchase homes at a low cost, rehab them, and sell or rent them out for an astronomical amount of money. Governor Hogan's efforts to combat blight does not effectively accommodate Baltimore as a whole. For my district specifically, it will produce more pollution, rodents, and potentially eliminate neighborhoods altogether due to the abundance of vacant properties.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is poor budgeting of the finances and lack of effective planning.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe the current balance of power between the Mayor and City Council is appropriate. However, the issue is some of our current leadership have become complacent and don't wish to take the time to effectively plan before executing.</p>",
    "q8":"City Council has not been focused on the right issues. The main focus has been accommodating only certain areas of Baltimore with the exception of the more rural communities. They have been overlooked and neglected.</p>",
    "q9":"The weaknesses I see in the delivery of city services, is lack of urgency and resources to resolve issues. Issues can be categorized by urgency and regularly scheduled follow ups and audits can be done to confirm the issues have been addressed, and or, resolved in a timely manner. An attempt to recruit more volunteers to assist with addressing the concerns as well. Those seeking or needing to complete customer service hours can be utilized. Or those simply seeking experience. Each Council representative should be responsible for staying on top of making sure these services have been provided.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office because of my genuine concern for progression instead of regression, as well as, being an individual who plans strategically and will exhaust all efforts to effectively get results, which is what our city currently need. I have lived in my district the majority of my life and a lot of the community's issues directly affect my family and it's time for much needed change, which I can very much so assist with due to having a great understanding of these issues.</p>"

    "q1":"First, they want to build an incinerator to overburden one of the most polluted communities in Baltimore City. We need to make the Maryland Department of Energy adhere to their own laws and not press this project forward under expired permits due to no construction in 18 months. Secondly, is the crime and prostitution. While working with the local police, it is not just enough just to text when you see something happening or call 911, you need to find out who owns these houses on your block where there is a consistent flow for drugs, prostitution and resale of stolen merchandise and call the absentee landlord and make them aware of the situation. Communities must start taking responsibility at the street level and work up using the framework of law already in place. The only way to get things done is to be consistent.</p>",
    "q2":"Police Officers are understandably working in a tough situation. If more community involvement was present, then I believe that the abuses that have been cited in the system will lessen. When no one is being held accountable for their actions, corruption is bred. Each person at the community level needs to be accountable for the street where they live. Residents need to change their mindset that someone else is going to take care of this. The deeper root cause of crime is the fractured family unit which has led to people making the wrong choices. Every community association needs to be active and call the local police district and utilize the police representation there. The officers come to the meetings with crime stats - engage them and learn how you can help.</p>",
    "q3":"I saw a city fed up with the status quo. The riots could have been about anything, but people are angry and do not even know what they are angry at. Freddie Gray was born to a drug addicted mother, haphazardly raised in the projects by a variety of people who were not his parents, and because of that he did not know what was right and therefore made wrong choices. He did not stand a chance, and this is the saddest aspect of his story. The monetary civil settlement, using taxpayer money, is being used to reward bad behavior, and I find this appalling. The people of Baltimore do not know that the anger they feel needs to be directed at the system that has failed them. Democrats have been in charge of that \"system\" FOR 50 YEARS, and the sooner the voters realize this, the sooner we can start educating people on how their elected officials have failed them. Consequentially, the Republican solutions will begin to make sense.</p>",
    "q4":"The property taxes should be reduced by 50% to be at least in line with our neighboring counties. To replace the reduced revenue, every agency in the City needs to be audited and the employees need to held criminally accountable for fraud and mismanagement of taxpayer funds. Instead of offering handouts to get businesses to come here, negotiate the tax incentive to a market rate; when you give something away for free does not have any value to the recipient. Small business would succeed better if the property taxes were lower thus producing reasonable rents instead of over-inflated property values.</p>",
    "q5":"If property taxes were lower thereby making housing more affordable neighborhoods would be able to assimilate revitalizing troubled properties one block at a time. Empty lots could be utilized for small parks featuring child friendly equipment and benches for socializing, or community gardens. Move home owners in using the Vacants to Value program and negotiate commercial property incentives to be affordable for small business owners. Vacants to Value is a good concept, but it needs to be audited quarterly so the City can monitor the true progress of the program and to verify the recipients continue to live in the home according to contract. Governor Hogan's initiative is a step in the right direction, if the funds are used as they are intended and not mismanaged.</p>",
    "q6":"There are three parts to economic development and job creation. First, there needs to be an incentive for a job creating businesses to move into the City or for residents to start a new business in Baltimore City. The second part is a work force with a strong work ethic. Thirdly, is to have accountable and transparent city agencies with streamlined processes. Decades of unaccountable city agencies have put us in this mess, but city employees and politicians need to be held responsible for their actions so the result will be that the next elected or appointed official takes the job seriously. If you do not perform then you should not have that job. If you mismanage funds, you are a criminal and need to be prosecuted to the law's extent. Compare this to what happens now, so-called Civil Servants getting a slapped on the hand and allowed to run again for another office all while still collecting a pension from the taxpayers. The people need to wake up and realize they are being robbed twice.</p>",
    "q7":"The balance of power should fall on the side of the City Council. 14 City Council members can represent the entire population of the City better than 1 mayor. The City Council will equalize the representation for each of the voters' concerns for their district. Regardless of the balance of power, the City Council needs to be more transparent. For an example of this, the City Council meets weekly, but the journal of minutes take more than a year to be posted for public viewing. If we can get new officials in place dedicated to making the city better rather than making a name for themselves and getting a pension, then we may have a foundation to build on.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council has not been focusing on the right issues for the past 50 years. If they were, we would not be in this situation: spiraling towards bankruptcy, having riots, and increasing generational poverty. Change the makeup of the Council and you will change the results for the City and its residents.</p>",
    "q9":"Back to the core issue, we need to make each agency responsible for their own employees and the outcome of their actions by implementing community surveys, customer service training, and regular audits. Then the taxpayers will experience improvement. Make city employees wear name tags so they are not just someone doing a job anonymously. Have procedures in place for bad behavior and reward good behavior.</p>",
    "q10":"The people need a choice. There has been 50 years of FAILED democratic rule in Baltimore City. Our property taxes are over twice that of our neighboring counties and what do we have to show for it? The people need a voice that speaks to accountable government, small business to promote jobs, neighborhood revitalization, and school choice.</p>"

    "q1":"There are several pressing issues in the 11th District, including public safety, quality of education, public transportation and access to jobs, and taxes.</p><p>Public safety - we need to advance the community policing model. I supported body cameras and will seek further policy changes to ensure effective community policing.</p><p>Quality of education – we need more community schools. I will continue to work hand-in-hand with Promise Heights in CW Baltimore and work with my State counterparts in the General Assembly to identify funding opportunities for additional community school programming. </p><p>Public transportation and access to jobs – we need a well-integrated public transportation system. I will continue to advocate for reform to MTA and fight for permanent funding for the Circulator and expansion of the system.</p><p>Taxes – we need to provide substantial tax relief for residents and businesses. I will continue to work with the Administration, the Council, and our State counterparts to identify and implement changes aimed at providing substantial tax relief.</p>",
    "q2":"Yes, Baltimore City is pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime. BPD is targeting violent offenders with our Federal partners (ATF, Drug Enforcement Agency, FBI, US Marshals, and US Secret Service) and working with the States Attorney to get these individuals off the streets. As of 02/08/2016, we have suffered 20 homicides, down considerably (about 25%) from this time last year. Other categories of violent crime which are down include rape and aggravated assault. Other strategies are aiding the crime fight, include a heavy emphasis on community policing, increased presence of patrolling officers (outside of their vehicles), and the recent body camera pilot program, which is expected to be implemented soon. </p><p>Yes, I have full faith in Commissioner Davis and was the first Councilmember to publicly support him after he was appointed by the Mayor. He seems to have a better relationship with the officers on the streets, as opposed to his predecessor.</p><p>Improving community and police relations is going to be a long process, and should be centered on rebuilding trust. BPD must have the trust of the neighborhoods it serves, and that starts with respect and better communication. During my tenure on the Council, I have focused a large portion of my public safety efforts on facilitating and improving communications between community and business leaders with BPD.</p>",
    "q3":"There are several systemic and underlying issues which exist not only in Baltimore, but across many large cities in America. Issues with community relations, policing practices, socio-economic disparity, and access to quality education, are all vital to the discussion. </p><p>The lesson I learned is how complex and intertwined these issues are and that we all need to work together to resolve these deep rooted problems. Addressing each issue individually will not resolve our problems. We need to focus on resolutions that address more than just one area. For example, if community and police relations improve, but we don't develop economic opportunities and jobs in places where they are needed most, the drug market will continue to disrupt these areas. If economic and educational opportunities are built, but the relationship and trust between the community and police fails to improve, then we will not be able to solve crime. </p><p>During my time as Councilmember, I've had the chance to meet and hear from people doing great work towards addressing these issues. I want to make sure these individuals have the opportunity to voice their opinions and be part of the discussions regarding how we grow stronger from this.</p><p>With respect to the City's response to the unrest, there were several lessons to be learned, none more important than the need for better communication from the City to residents and businesses. The Joint Information Center was a sorely needed step in the right direction.</p>",
    "q4":"In order to grow, Baltimore City needs to continue to reduce property taxes. While property taxes have incrementally decreased for principal home owners over the past few years, we need to continue to explore ways to provide substantial tax relief. Having been selected by the Mayor to serve on the Tax Policy Review Group, I've gained a better understanding of the many challenges and complexities we face in trying to find solutions that do not cut core services or negatively impact our bond rating. Perhaps the biggest obstacle is that we live in a City built for 1M, yet we have a population of about 630K. </p><p>The most significant thing we can do to decrease property taxes is to grow our population. The current Administration and Live Baltimore are pursuing a number of initiatives aimed at both retention and growth, and more can be done. </p><p>Many of the issues the Tax Policy Review Group explored have minimal impact on property tax reduction. SDAT reform, which is ongoing and requires General Assembly partnership, would provide for more accurate, fair, and equitable taxation. We need to address revenue loss such as property owners incorrectly receiving the Homestead Tax Credit, uncaptured tax on Air BnB transactions, and inaccurate assessments of commercial properties.</p><p>Because of the City's limited access to capital for infrastructure improvements, TIFs may be necessary to grow the City. As with any incentive, the Council should ensure it leaves the City in a better position as a result of the project.</p>",
    "q5":"With over 16,000 vacant homes in the City, this is and should be a top priority. The current level of blight is something that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. </p><p>Although the Governor's announcement appears to be grossly overstating the amount of new money available to Baltimore City, I am encouraged by new demolition funds being made available to the City. Combining the Governors proposed demolition funding with the City's increased financial commitment will help accelerate blight elimination. </p><p>Vacants-To-Value has been successful, particularly given the current economic environment. Since the inception of the program, as of August 2015, the City has demolished almost 1,300 vacant houses and sold over 800 vacant houses, of which approximately 300 occupancy use permits. </p><p>There are opportunities to do more, all with the goal of reducing the number of City-owned vacants. For example, there are other useful programs we should continue to leverage, such as the Baltimore Regional Neighborhoods Initiative (BRNI). State BRNI grants provide funding to community development corporations to implement neighborhood revitalization strategies within the State-designated sustainability areas designated by the Baltimore Planning Department. Having the Reservoir Hill area expanded to include Druid Heights in the 11th would make sense, considering its proximity to two anchor institutions, MICA and Coppin State, along the North Avenue corridor. BRNI grants provide additional funding to leverage existing investment, and have proven to be successful.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers to economic development and job creation include a disproportionate property tax rate, lack of preparedness to take on jobs in the new Baltimore economy, the lack of a regional comprehensive public transportation system, and public safety perception and reality.</p><p>The disproportionate property tax rate compared to surrounding jurisdictions makes it more expensive and less attractive to develop in Baltimore City. With a property tax rate that is highest in the State, I will continue to support initiatives aimed at reducing our rate.</p><p>There is work to be done to ensure preparedness for jobs in the new Baltimore economy. This is one of the reasons I have been supportive of TechHire and incubators and accelerators.</p><p>Without a comprehensive public transportation system, access to existing and newly created jobs is a hardship for a large portion of the City's population. Amazon, which employs 3,600 people, has had to run its own transportation system with loans from the City. We need to work with the Governor to make sure Baltimore Link truly connects residents to jobs.</p><p>Public safety has an impact on economic development, whether it is perception or reality, and Baltimore City has a reputation that does impact some development. There is a perception that the City is unsafe and the reality is that the property tax rate is the highest in the state, creating an environment in which it is difficult for Baltimore to compete with surrounding counties.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore City has historically had one of the strongest Mayoral systems among large cities in the Nation. There are several proposed initiatives aimed at diluting the Office of the Mayor's power and shifting that power to the Council. While I am generally supportive, I think it is incredibly important to have an open dialogue about shared governance and the difference between the Executive and Legislative branches of government. Making changes to the City Charter should only be done if the result improves the way the City operates.</p>",
    "q8":"During my 16 months on the Council, I wish there had been more opportunities to discuss issues related to public safety, quality of education, public transportation and access to jobs, and substantial tax relief. </p><p>We have suffered an alarmingly high number of homicides and non-fatal shootings. The City cannot sustain another year of violence like we did in 2015. The Council needs to give more attention to this issue.</p><p>The Council's work on TransForm Baltimore is important, and it is imperative that we pass the new zoning code before the end of the term, as it is out of date and has not been updated in over 40 years. </p><p>The Council has also raised the importance of performance audits. Given my GAO background and experience, I believe that I provide a critical voice on the Council on effective auditing processes.</p>",
    "q9":"There are several quality of life issues which require immediate attention. For example, street lights should never be out for more than 24 hours, trash and recycling should always be picked up on time, and potholes should be filled within 7 days of being reported (all three examples are weather permitting, of course).</p><p>The 311 process is extremely frustrating for citizens. The process to request City services can be improved through streamlining inter-agency communications. Often times, a service request will be routed to the wrong agency, resulting in a service request being closed, then internally a new service request is created with a different agency. The citizen checks the status of the service request, the system indicates it is closed, with no explanation, and the issue persists, which in turn frustrates citizens. Our City needs a modernized 311 system which sends email, text, and phone alerts to citizens with status updates. A simple example is the tracking system UPS uses.</p>",
    "q10":"I never imagined a year and a half ago that I would be in this position. Bar none, this has been most rewarding experience of my life. It is a very challenging job and can be wildly frustrating at times -especially when the answer is right in front of you and we don't have the resources or power to fix the problem. I've done this job full-time since my first day, resigning from my previous position as an IT Auditor with the US Government Accountability Office the day I was sworn in. It is very humbling to represent the 11th District and I hope to continue to do so for 4 more years. I genuinely enjoy helping people solve problems and that is why I am running.</p>"

I would also partnership with the state & federal government; public & provide institutions to train, recruit and hire qualified teachers. I would advocate for an enhanced curriculum that better prepares students to meet the challenges of an increasingly and extremely competitive international job market.</p>",
   "q2": "<p>I do have confidence in the current police leadership in partnership with the community to develop strategies to reduce crime and foster mutual respect and understanding among citizens and the police. Unfortunately to date the City has gone through 5 police commissioners over the past few years. These changes served to confuse the rank & file supervisors and officers working in the neighborhoods. With frequent changes in police leadership came changes in protocols and policy which added to the confusion by police regarding what they can and cannot do.</p><p>I would open more recreation centers with renovated and modernized facilities. Recreation Centers must become safe havens for youth and opportunities for them to channel their energy, stay fit, practice teamwork, develop leadership skills, and remain competitive. It has been proven statistically that such opportunities help our youth to stay in school, avoid criminal behavior and as a result reduce juvenile delinquency, and their involvement in street gangs. It is also much more cost effective than building more high-tech prisons. Yet, our city continues to close down recreation centers, schools and libraries.</p>",
   "q3": "<p>\"BLACK LIVES MATTER\" & ALL LIVES MATTER \"FROM THE WOMB TO THE TOMB\"</p><p>Miscommunication between agencies & the public: 1. The Mayor over stepped boundaries by saying police need to leave space for those to destroy</p><p>2.

The Police Commissioner & his command, under the orders of the Mayor, failed to take appropriate actions & prevent protesters from rioting</p><p>4. The School Police & other officials should not have stopped the bus service which left many teen aged children at schools & bus stops</p><p>5. Some Irrational decisions were generally made all around all agencies & city offices. Plans for unrest should have been in place from the riots of 1968 & 70's Police Strike</p><p>7. City officials quickly laid blame instead of looking for root causes of the unrest in the city (lack of jobs & opportunities, perceptions of police brutality nationwide, repercussions from past Zero Tolerance practices, drug abuse, lack of education & trust in law enforcement, failure to build trust w/t factions. Use community mediations & conflict resolution strategy, expand programs like Safe Streets & HCPI to more areas in the city, recruit new members & form partnerships. Restore the trust & mutual respect between the Police & Community</p><p>The final lesson is the need elect new leaders to the City Council who address the City's needs & bring fresh viewpoints</p>",

Advertise and post \"mobile employment center\" schedules--destinations, dates and times it will be in each area</p><p>Partnership with unions, local businesses, and colleges to train unskilled employment seekers for the job market. Reward and provide incentives to businesses who hire a certain amount of locals. For example, lower tax rates and reduced prices on city owned land. Baltimoreans should have a \"window of opportunity into every business in the city\"! Develop an \"It benefits to hire local\" mentality. </p><p>Partner with the governor, universities, business leaders, and developers, local, national and international institutions & corporations to create jobs and provide career opportunities for the citizens of Baltimore... Provide tax incentives and tax relief when appropriate.</p>",
   "q7": "<p>No. The City Council also represents the citizens of Baltimore; and instead of changing the balance of power I would ensure that city council members use their vote, their influence and power on the council to represent their constituents needs and concerns, and encourage them to demonstrate strong leadership at the committee level where very important work is done.</p><p>We must fully fund recreations centers, youth and after school programs, triple the number of summer jobs and prepare youth for education and career opportunities. If youth are involved in constructive activities, they are less likely to join gangs and more likely to become productive citizens.</<p>",

Also identify those who require special attention, such as the elderly, individuals with serious mental illnesses and other challenging disabilities. Target problem houses and devote attention and adequate resources to high crime areas...</p><p>Ensure the state's attorney's office, the police department, and city hall prioritize public safety and work together to reduce crime which was a major factors to lower the crime rate drastically in NYC.</p><p>Foster a better relationship with citizens and regain their confidence and trust. </p><p>Protect citizen's property to ensure their cars and residence are not easy targets for criminals by conducting awareness campaign and sting operations.</p><p>-Advocate for our seniors to ensure their concerns are taking seriously and their needs are met. Create a safer and more pleasant environment for our seniors.</p>",
   "q9": "<p>City Services need to be more efficient, customer service oriented, and new training procedures should be implemented in areas where the city has struggled to provide adequate services in the timely matter. Departmental supervisors must be held accountable for the lack of smooth delivery of city services including agencies like the Dept. of Public Works, Sanitation, Recreation and Parks, Public Safety, Parking and Transportation. </p><p>Promote proactive law enforcement strategies through issuance of criminal citations that allow officers to enforce the law while providing a high visibility. However, officers must be able to triage to determine and distinguish between that incidence that require the issuance of citations and those which require a stricter legal handling. Moreover, develop infrastructure that provide police officers with options that prevent crime when arrests are not warranted, such as social services, drug recovery and transitional services, etc. Partnership with residence, neighborhood associations, organizations, businesses and quasi governmental agencies to initiate strategies to deter, report, and prevent crime, for example COP (Citizens On Patrol), \"Crime Watcher\", and \"Community Watch\" programs. Statistics indicate that such programs successful reduce crime rates in the areas in which they are properly and consistently operated. </p>",

I look forward, as the 12th District Councilman, to working with our citizens to satisfy their legitimate concern, goals, and needs including providing a better education for our youth, safer and cleaner neighbors, supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship, eliminating blight, and providing affordable housing, and create jobs that pay a living wage. By working with diverse groups of people during my life, I have learned to solve complex problems and to understand the many sides of an issue. </p><p>I have worked as a property manager, state commissioned officer, and transportation supervisor at Johns Hopkins University. I have served as an urban youth minister at two inner city churches, and I am currently an active member of Saint Ignatius and Sts. Philip and James Churches.

    "q1":"The most pressing issues in District 12 also exist city-wide. Our politicians are selling us out. When a big, rich, multinational company calls up city hall our leaders roll out the red carpet. They offer huge tax breaks, free or reduced land, and quickly cut through all the red tape that the rest of us have to deal with.</p><p>When I, Ian Schlakman, am your Baltimore City Councilor, I will make it clear to the developers and to big business that Baltimore and it's people are not for sale to the highest bidder. </p><p>The City's strategy of investing in large-scale development projects for elite businesses needs to stop. We can trace these developments from the downtown Hilton to the Grand Prix to the Exelon tower in Harbor East, and through the expansion of Johns Hopkins into neighborhoods that haven't been best served by any of these projects. These projects and dozens more were funded instead of the Red Line, better bus routes, homeless shelters, parks, rec centers, quality schools, and much more. </p><p>Most Baltimore residents would cite crime, education, and failing city infrastructure as the most pressing issues in their district, and they are right. We can improve all of these by drawing the line on city investment in private projects and the loss of future tax funding because of TIFs and other tax breaks. With funds to invest in world-class schools, modern transit, infrastructure and neighborhood development, we can change the way Baltimoreans live, travel, and thrive.</p>",
    "q2":"No amount of investment in new police officers, training or equipment can reduce violent crime. Spending on these police tools can change the police department's response to violent crime, but it does nothing to prevent violent crime from happening in the first place. The police department must make it clear to the City Council that only a massive investment in communities can prevent the conditions that cause violent crime. One of the reasons people turn to violent crime is because they have no viable access to jobs and are then unable to provide for their family.</p><p>Community / police relations will improve when city residents no longer have to turn to criminal activities to support themselves and their families. The City Council must work to legalize and regulate the sale of marijuana, and cut off funding the failed War on Drugs. They must find ways to decrease the 50% of young, black men who are either in jail or under the supervision of the criminal justice system, making it difficult to find employment. The City Council needs to work with private employers to provide incentives for hiring ex-felons. They also need to work to fund a massive public works project designed to rebuild our city's crumbling infrastructure with the help of every worker unable to find a job in the city.</p>",
    "q3":"Anyone currently in city government who didn't see the riots and looting coming needs to be held responsible. Anyone in office who knew how bad things were out there but did nothing to improve the situation should be voted out. Our city government has failed our city's youth.</p><p>Activists, advocacy groups, young people, and those that mentor our young people have been telling us for years that our city's children are in deep trouble. The rate of unemployment in young African American communities is near 50%. Every year when the city puts on it's annual summer jobs program the line to join stretches for blocks.</p><p>Community control of police forces is vital to peace. Neighborhoods know which police officers have a history of violence and aggression in the area. Communities need to have the authority to remove these officers from those neighborhoods. The city's Civilian Review Board needs to have the authority to impose discipline on officers who have shown a history of violence. The police department overall needs to be less militarized and show a more appropriate response to minor incidents.</p>",
    "q4":"Most families taxes in Baltimore are incredibly high. And there's a simple explanation for it: Wealthy corporations get all the tax breaks. To make up for all the lost revenue working families and small businesses have to pay more.</p><p>I am the anti-corporate tax break candidate. No more tax breaks for rich out-of-state businesses who use Baltimore as a source of cheap labor. If you're an out-of-state business that wants to come into Baltimore you need to pay your fair share of taxes and you need to pay the people here a decent wage of at least $15 per hour.</p><p>Tax breaks, such as Tax Increment Funding (TIF), Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) and other incentives to encourage development are the core of Baltimore's inability to invest in basic needs like quality schools, roads, public transportation, and social services. The loss of future tax income when we give out these tax breaks prevents Baltimore from investing in larger-scale community development projects such as municipal homeless shelters, public hospitals, a city-wide basic income guarantee, and a free college education at city institutions. </p><p>The city can raise all local taxes without community backlash if it can show that increased tax revenue is being spent on the people's needs for basic and advanced city services, rather than on massive, private development projects.</p>",
    "q5":"Why don't we house every homeless family in Baltimore? We obviously have a surplus of housing. It's the right thing too, of course. The answer is simple: there's no money to be made in housing them.</p><p>That's why I will be kind of leader that always does what's right, not just what's profitable. We need the political will to take care of all of our residents in Baltimore, not just the ones who are rich.</p><p>Thousands of Baltimoreans experience homelessness on a daily basis. Providing housing can give many of these city residents the chance they need to get off the streets. Institute a program to train city residents in renovating city-owned vacant properties and use them to provide housing for people in need of a place to live. Many cities, including large ones like Salt Lake City, have found success with this model.</p><p>Once enough housing has been found to house everyone in need, the Vacants to Value program should be expanded to allow everyone who wants to own and invest in a home to do so. Access to quality housing should be considered a human right and shared city resource, and it should be as inexpensive as possible for everyone to take advantage of. </p><p>The City should treat its housing stock as a precious resource. Vacant houses should be demolished only as a last resort when rehabilitation isn't an option. Demolishing homes to create new open space for sale to developers is another unnecessary handout to corporate developers.</p>",
    "q6":"My wife and I own a small business fixing computers for schools in the inner city. I also consult with people looking to open up their own small business in the city.</p><p>If you're a big business from out-of-state the city will roll out the red carpet with tax breaks, land giveaways and help with the red tape. The rest of us have to pay tons of taxes, pay high rents for office space and wait in endless lines for permits.</p><p>We need to make it easier for locals to open up small businesses in the city. We also need to teach vocational skills in and out of our school system. This means a young adult fresh out of high school or college will have a much easier time starting their own business with a vocational skill that can help their community.</p><p>I'm proposing that our city took a look at new creative options for developing the local economy. This includes worker cooperatives, more co-working spaces, small business incubators, urban farms and complete streets that promote more pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p>Recently the United Workers gave a presentation at University of Maryland School of Social Work about Community Land Trusts. They produced a white paper that spells out exactly how to help communities increase home ownership for our lower income residents. We need city councilors that applaud, listen, and help when our citizens tell us how to improve their neighborhoods. That's the kind of councilperson I intend to be.</p>",
    "q7":"Our mayor has far too much power. When there's an emergency such as a snow storm, hurricane or riot, we need to exclusively rely on a mayor who wasn't elected to handle such tragic situations.</p><p>The mayor also directly controls nearly every department in the city. That means a mayor who knows nothing about how to deal with crime and homelessness is still in charge of both of those departments.</p><p>This model, known as the strong mayor model, is an incredibly outdated decades old way of running a city. We need to modernize this and do away with the strong mayor model. There needs to be far more collaboration with the city council and community input when it comes to appointing department heads that run the city. </p><p>Certain departments, such as the dept of city planning need far more independence while other departments, such as the police, need far more community input.</p><p>We absolutely need an elected school board. Concerned parents and kids often find themselves going to school board meetings and leaving in sheer frustration. I know I've stood shoulder to shoulder with teachers, parents, and students protesting more stricter testing, crumbling school buildings and school leadership that doesn't listen to the community.</p><p>An elected school board would mean that teachers and parents can do more than just protest. They can start organizing as they rally their community to get them on the school board and directly fix the problems. Anything less than an elected school board is anti-democratic.</p>",
    "q8":"I will focus on getting immediate help to families that work full time but are still struggling to make it. I will do this by proposing a $15 an hour minimum wage bill tied to inflation. I've already been working on this issue as an activist and I know exactly who else we'd need to push on the council to get this passed.</p><p>I will focus on ending the monopolies that are financially crippling us. This means I will work to end the cities exclusive agreements with Comcast so that we can have more TV and Internet providers. </p><p>I will create an alternative to BGE in the form of a city wide power coop where our citizens will be installing solar panels and wind turbines right in the city. This will create new green jobs for people, help our environment and slash your utility bills.</p><p>I will also be the anti-corporate tax break candidate. The City Council needs to draw a line in the sand - not one more TIF, PILOT or tax break for a company looking to do business at Baltimore's expense. The City Council needs to focus its energies solely on investing in a major public works project to allow Baltimoreans to work and rebuild our transit, health, education, and safety infrastructure.</p>",
    "q9":"It was here in District 12 where 26th street collapsed. For years the residents complained about the condition of the street, the sidewalk, and the retaining wall that eventually collapsed. The city didn't want to deal with it simply because it wasn't something that could be easily fixed.</p><p>We need to improve our infrastructure city-wide, but especially in District 12 as we have many rail lines and are a transit corridor for the rest of the city.</p><p>Our city needs more investment. I am the only candidate in the race who regularly talks to our city planners and regularly looks at other cities around the world for the most creative and modern methods to make sure our infrastructure is up-to-date and benefits everyone in Baltimore, not just the wealthy.</p><p>The City needs to invest in a massive public works project to rebuild and improve our infrastructure in transit, water, sewer, electricity, schools, and more. By giving jobs to Baltimoreans, we can build a world-class school, and transit system. We can provide free or low-cost, city-wide high speed internet and build a system of parks and green spaces to improve the health and well-being of all city residents. We can provide housing for all and develop public hospitals to provide quality medical care for all. Once we see Baltimore as a resource that all of us have the right to use instead of a space for businesses to scoop up and re-sell at premium rates, Baltimore residents will truly be satisfied.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running becuase we need a city councilor that will put people before profits!</p><p>Every month our city finds new ways to give more city services to multi-national corporations. That puts the concerned citizen in a state of constantly fighting against water privatization, bus services being privatized, polluting incinerators being built right next to schools, etc...</p><p>Enough is Enough! We need a leader in city hall who will lead the fight against these giveaways and put people before profits.</p><p>I am the one candidate in this race that will consistently fight against give aways to large corporations. I will never pander to corporate interests.</p><p>I have a vision for a Baltimore in which the City Council prioritizes the needs of people - the right to fair wages, quality housing, health care and income security - first. </p><p>And I have a plan for winning a $15/hour minimum wage, stopping all corporate tax give aways, ending the monopolies of BGE and Comcast, and immediately housing the city's homeless population. All it takes is the recognition that the people of Baltimore - not the corporations of Baltimore - are what matter.</p>"

   "q1": "One Saturday evening this September outdoor tables at a restaurant on Preston Street near Calvert were full of people enjoying a night out while three blocks east, just across Greenmount Avenue, 8 people were shot – including a three-year-old girl. Zip code shouldn’t determine that little girl’s destiny. But it has started to already. She will carry the trauma of that event into a school system that gives her “the same” resources as kids in safer neighborhoods that aren’t full of vacant buildings, as if “equal” was fair to her. She’ll live in a neighborhood with too many shootings but that is policed with the same number of officers as a quiet, leafy neighborhood to the north where no one fears getting shot. Her mom will live too far away for the free Circulator to be convenient, and she’ll be forced to keep a job while relying on an MTA bus that is usually late. These are just examples of the hardships in store for that little girl. So to answer the question, there is one issue in the District, and it leads to all others: between the neighborhoods to the west of Greenmount Avenue, and the neighborhoods to the east, there is a deep disparity in economic opportunity, job access, housing quality, safety, and educational outcomes. Our government takes a one-size-fits-all approach to our neighborhoods when in fact it has to acknowledge this disparity, and restructure itself to undo that disparity. My proposals to address this are below.</p>",
   "q2": "I trust the reports I get from people who know the Commissioner better than I do that he is a good man with his head and his heart in the right place. But BPD is facing a crisis of purpose. What should it look like after the drug war, and after we stop low-quality, high-volume arrest practices, and after we stop clogging the courts with cannabis possession arrests? We can focus our efforts by answering these questions. We spent almost $500 million on the department last year yet shootings are homicides remain at historic highs. We have a department of 3000 sworn officers and yet the Eastern District gets only 13 officers on the street per shift. The answer is strategy, not money. “Ceasefire” is a strategy that uses intelligence, not street rips, to identify networks of violent actors and then directly engage them, to weed out those who want a way out from those who are headed to prison. “Safe Streets” is a violence-interruption strategy that uses the skills and talents of those who were once on the streets to engage those who still are, to settle the petty beefs that lead to shootings. “Procedural Justice” is a strategy that uses fairness as a crime reduction tool, requiring police and courts to engage suspects and others with neutrality and respect as a way to build legitimacy and trust in the system. (Think of it as the opposite of what we all saw on the Sandra Bland video.)</p>",
   "q3": "I draw three lessons. First, it doesn’t matter how stable and prosperous some of our neighborhoods become if the rest of the city is left behind. Second, our leaders have grown so accustomed to our challenges and our disparities as a city that they all had to be reminded of what it is really like to live on the wrong side of that disparity. In this District, for as long as there has been someone named Stokes on the ballot the Mount Vernon side of Biddle Street has been one thing, and just blocks down the street to the east, across Greenmount Avenue, Johnston Square has been something else. Every 50 years we get a reminder this is not acceptable. Will we need another? Third, the events of April 2015 will mark the end of how we have tried to solve problems for decades. A network of institutions have worked tirelessly and in good faith to hold at bay the inequalities that reared their head so clearly last April: downtown business interests (for example, the Greater Baltimore Committee), the foundation community (examples: Abell, Weinberg, Casey), the faith community (the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, BUILD) and the government itself (Schools, Police, City Hall). Last April was a rejection of this status quo, and the solutions it has produced so far. Now in the wake of the Justice Department report on our police department – an historical indictment on us all – we need to work together, work differently, and be bold. </p>",
   "q4": "Our tax problem is not about price, but value. The people I’m talking to daily in the District are committed to a city and a neighborhood they love. It won’t be taxes that push them but instead (1) all the extra costs and hassles they incur because essential services are not delivered, or, (2) living in or near a neighborhood of low opportunity and disinvestment. These two things are related, since disinvestment and decay create a drag on city services. To encourage stability District-wide, our tax system must tackle disinvestment, and I detail a proposal for that below. As for TIFs and PILOTs, my main concern is the school funding formula, and that our schools are not penalized by these arrangements. I also do not think city government is adequately staffed to assess and manage these decades-long deals, which tend to be heavily developer- and consultant-driven. More fundamentally, these deals tend to be reactive – based on who comes knocking – and not clearly linked to a broad and fairly distributed development strategy. I worry we sometimes act like a kid on prom night who still doesn’t have a date and is ready to say yes to the first person who asks. I’d rather we look inward to our strengths, decide what we really want, and be willing to go to the dance alone if the right proposal doesn’t come along.</p>",
   "q5": "Every city on the East Coast is full of neighborhoods that, fifteen years ago, people said would never come back, but did. We don’t have enough comeback neighborhoods. I see no excuse for this when I gaze down upon Harbor Point from the intersection of Eden and Federal Street, or look down the tree-lined boulevards of Lafayette Avenue or Lanvale Street towards the beautiful old Brewery Building on Gay. I propose a long-term tax break for neighborhoods with too many vacants that would reduce the effective tax rate on residential structures to 1.1% -- a cut in half, to the County rate. In combination with a low- or no-interest loan program for renovation we can help current residents invest, and new residents move in. As for Vacants-to-Value, it is a terrific program, but it tends to accelerate investment that’s already on the way. In a city headed in the right direction, the number of vacant buildings on the north side of Patterson Park, or in Oliver, or Greenmount West, would naturally fall as families looking for new opportunities moved in. And as for the Governor’s plan, more demolition is a good thing where we need it, but the plan relies on a strategy that has failed at the Super Block downtown, Poppleton on the west side, and now in Park Heights, where the big developer with all the answers and all the money hasn’t materialized. We need families and small developers to lead the way. </p>",
   "q6": "The most significant barrier is a school system that is not training our children for the 21st Century. I want to end the disconnect between the schools and City Hall, where Council hearings are about budget money, but not school performance. Just look at City Hall’s $200 million rec center plan. It makes no mention of a separate $1 billion dollar school construction plan, even though both are meant for the same kids, and address the same buildings – all of which the city owns. This is wasteful. We can also see the disconnect in all the programs for our children – schools, health, social services, job training programs, rec center programming – that don’t focus on the whole child. We need to regain control of our school system and start providing services with neighborhood-based teams, not multiple siloed agencies. The second barrier to jobs and growth is transit and transportation. I was a major supporter of the Red Line because it was a way to get people to jobs. In City Hall I fought a lot of people who thought it was too big, too expensive and too complicated. Our Republican Governor took it away and gave us bus system reforms that, at least based on early reports, “improve” the service by cutting it. Our people need to get to jobs. We need to answer this challenge the way all other metropolitan areas have, with a regional transit authority, for which I will advocate in concert with our state representatives.</p>",
   "q7": "The debates about the balance of power in city government would make more sense if there were proposals to make residents’ lives better that were being stymied by the current arrangement. Instead of those proposals, we’ve had fights for control. Looking past those, there are urgent questions. How can we make the Council a more effective legislative body? Do we need a Board of Estimates? Should the chief auditor of city spending be an elected politician? Beyond these, the more important “balance of power” question is between city and state. City Hall has little real control over the functioning of the police department – a state agency whose officers are protected from discipline by state law. It also has insufficient accountability for our schools – in effect a state agency largely separate from City Hall, as I discussed. The liquor board is a state agency, one that enforces state laws that have let sham “taverns” operate at all hours, creating hubs of disorder and violence in our neighborhoods. And as I said above, our residents’ economic destiny is in the hands of the MTA, a state agency we rely on to get to work, but that is treated as an unloved stepchild within the larger Maryland Department of Transportation. Instead of bickering with each other locally we should focus on regaining control of our destiny as a city.</p>",
   "q8": "The Council has dealt with important issues: the Council President pushed local hiring, Councilwoman Clarke the minimum wage, Councilman Henry government reform and affordable housing, and Councilman Scott has worked tirelessly on public safety. But too often the Council and its members get reduced to complaint-takers of first and last resort within a government that does not work. Our problems don’t result because someone was sick from work that day, or because something that usually gets done didn’t. They run deeper, and are usually systemic and structural. The Council must champion solutions. The hearings held last year about difficulties with the CitiStat program were an opportunity to tackle real issues (discussed below). Hearings held last year about the school budget were an opportunity to investigate the working relationship between City Hall and North Avenue. The Council has to take these opportunities for the sake of their constituents. It also has to be a place of serious deliberation about our challenges as a city, and results. We just can’t allow something as important as the zoning code overhaul – a critical tool for growth and development – to flounder for years in the Council chamber. </p>",
   "q9": "When I worked in City Hall and I encountered someone with a problem I’d always ask whether they had called 311. And then get laughed at. No one has faith in the system that is our lifeline to essential services, and often residents get the run around, passed from one agency to another. To address this, I worked extensively on a technical overhaul of 311 (which sadly went nowhere). We need more than a better 311 system, however. Behind that phone number is a network of agencies and departments buried in confused lines of authority, overlapping responsibility, and dropped handoffs – among five different maintenance departments and four or five different construction programs. More than that, city services are provided with no respect for neighborhood boundaries. Central Baltimore neighborhoods are caught between three police districts whose lines don’t match the neighborhoods. Each of those police districts are equally sized across the city, as if our public safety challenges were equally sized across all neighborhoods. Moreover, we now know that much of what we once handled as a police problem is better handled as a public health matter, but our Health and Police departments have not been reformed accordingly. The structure of our government hasn’t been seriously reviewed in almost 70 years, and it shows. There are short-term fixes to make service delivery better, but no easy answers will substitute for a long-term vision. I am calling for a Charter Convention to restructure our government for the 21st Century.</p>",
   "q10": "In mid-September I was at the groundbreaking of a new Food Hub in the heart of the East Side, which will repurpose beautiful old industrial spaces to create jobs and grow food. If I thought for one second our Democratic nominee had anything to do with making that great project happen, I would not be running. I’m here because good things are happening all over our District, but too often in spite of our leadership, not because of it. So many people believe in our neighborhoods. Families committed to the city, small developers with a vision to rebuild neighborhoods, creative professionals who want a vibrant, livable city, and all those who have lived here their entire lives hoping and praying that the place they grew up can turn the corner to stability. They are all routinely let down by the performance of their government, and their leaders. I saw first-hand how City Hall works, and how it doesn’t, first as an attorney with the Law Department, and then working for the Mayor until last year. As a civil rights attorney who spent years helping working families keep their homes, who defended victims of police misconduct, and who took what he learned as a lawyer in the private sector to do battle on behalf of the city, I know we can do better. As a long-time Democrat, I petitioned to get on the ballot as an independent so together, we can prove it. </p>"

    "q1":"1. Jobs. Many unemployed and under-employed residents lack the appropriate training and skills necessary to take advantage of the few jobs that do become available. Baltimore City must look beyond temporary fixes and attract companies in emerging markets. Only then, will the time spent on job training benefit our residents in the long-term and increase their potential to earn living wages for their families.</P><p>2. Economic opportunity and local businesses are lacking in our neighborhoods. I support efforts that involve bringing the City, the community and developers together to create a comprehensive plan to address the absence of commercial enterprises and that would encourage growth.</P><p>3. Education has been on the back burner far too long. Allocate a larger portion of the City budget to fund after school enrichment programs, hire more teachers (who are subject matter experts), hire social workers who can address the root causes of what prevents our kids from learning, and fund parent workshops to help parents/guardians learn how to be the best advocates for their children.</P><p>4. Public safety is a major issue that cannot be ignored. Safer streets come about with true community based policing. I would push for improved officer training and increased police-community relations as a starting point. Rebuilding the public trust and solving crimes go hand in hand.</p>",
    "q2":"There's tremendous room for improvement in Baltimore's crime reduction strategy. Some areas I would encourage and support as a councilperson would be: comprehensive officer training; improved interaction between police and the community at large; and better knowledge of the law, procedures and protocols to are a must to ensure and build a strong police department that is also trusted by the public. The present leadership is a work in progress.</p>",
    "q3":"Freddie Gray's death and the subsequent uprising brought abruptly and starkly into view for the world to see that Baltimore City's majority population has been ignored and their concerns marginalized by the political and economic power structure for decades. The resulting despair, desperation, discontent and isolation led to an eruption of emotion. The lesson is inclusion, and addressing economic, social and political needs and concerns. Inclusion in these ways will lead to real and lasting change in their lives. This is key to a successful future for Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore City's current tax structure needs a complete overhaul: not only property and income taxes, but also fees. Tax increment financing and payment in lieu of taxes have consistently been disproportionately utilized to support the wealthy and their goals. I support their use for community based development not more harbor projects.</p>",
    "q5":"Use financial instruments such as tax increment financing and payments in lieu taxes in community- based development. Use eminent domain legislation more proactively to acquire properties in largely vacant areas. If this is done with transparency it should open up these areas for further development. V2V should be used on a sliding scale basis with value increasing as development values escalate. I am encouraged by the efforts of Gov. Hogan. It's a welcome beginning.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier is lack of a long-term economic strategy. It's essential to bring together stakeholders in the private and public sectors to develop a comprehensive plan addressing the unique needs of each community. The youth must also have a place at the table. Long term goals must include: attracting new businesses while providing support for existing businesses to generate jobs; increase jobs and skills training opportunities in an effort to prepare City residents to take advantage of the newly generated jobs.</p>",
    "q7":"Limited changes are needed in the government structure. The budget process needs to allow for additions and/or cuts to the budget by the Council. The Board of Estimates needs a member who is separate from both the executive and legislative branches to ensure transparency. Perhaps a \"People's Counsel\" elected by the citizens.</p>",
    "q8":"The current council has definitely been focused on issues that are not true priorities More emphasis and attention needs to be placed on improving the functions of government, and accountability and controlling waste. A change in this direction should improve the council's responsiveness to the public.</p>",
    "q9":"Delivery of service is weak across the board. To improve response time and resident satisfaction, the City needs stronger and improved leadership, better training, fiscal accountability, less outside contractors, and more executive employees who live invested in the success of the City.</p>",
    "q10":"I've spent over 30 years helping and fighting for the community. I believe my passion for helping others and experience qualify me to be a true advocate for the 12th District.</p>"

    "q1":"One of the most pressing issues in my district is the lack of outlets for youth. There is little to nothing for the youth to do in many parts of the 13th district. Many young adults hang out in front of stores and bank machines. Some commit crimes. I would address this pressing issue by opening recreation centers in elementary schools in areas that do not have them. Also, I would take job literature to young men and women that are hanging around the neighborhood with out jobs. Moreover, in both Herring Run park and Clifton Park, there are five baseball/softball diamonds, but no baseball leagues for the youth. Thus, I would develop baseball leagues so that the youth can have fun, learn team work and be occupied.</p>",
    "q2":"It is hard to tell if Baltimore is pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime. We will need to compare last year's statistics to this year's statistics. I have met the current commissioner and he seems focused. As a city councilman, I would have police officers work/coach in the recreation centers. That way, they will know the youth, and the youth will know the officers.</p>",
    "q3":"The two main lessons that I draw from the death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent protests are that the police department needs to be more professional in certain areas i.e. transporting those that they arrest. Also, the youth need extracurricular activities: baseball, soccer, lacrosse. Moreover, if young people have jobs, they will be less likely to get involved in non productive activity.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore should reduce its property tax rates in areas that do not justify the percentage that it is taxed. Some neighborhoods have low tax rates, thus each neighborhood would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis. I think that it is a good idea to use tax increment financing because those developments bring jobs and in some cases, tourism dollars. Moreover, when a developer is given these incentives they should also build playgrounds, landscape and small building projects to beautify less developed neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore can encourage commercial and residential revitalization in neighborhoods away from the waterfront by adding in revitalization projects when they give tax incentives to developers. The Vacants to Value program probably needs to be revisited. Some properties don't warrant the amount that the city says must be invested. Governor Hogan stated that he will give $700 million to the effort of eradicating blight. It is much needed because neighborhoods that are full of abandoned homes are havens for crime and rodents. Once the buildings are demolished, there can be green space for sports, urban farming, landscaping or development.</p>",
    "q6":"Some areas are heavily crime ridden and they do not have the tax incentives that some jurisdictions may have. Also, the schools in certain areas are poor. If the city invests in programs like the teacher/cop next door, that might ignite development.</p>",
    "q7":"The current balance of power between the mayor and City Council seems appropriate. At this point I would not seek to change it.</p>",
    "q8":"Some City Councilmen and women have been focused on the right issues and some have been dormant. One poignant issue that I remember was when many in the city council requested body cameras on the Baltimore city police officers. The mayor declined, then later the Freddie Gray situation unfolded. If the officers had cameras, the police department and prosecutors would have an easier time figuring out what happened to him and how to proceed with improving those issues.</p>",
    "q9":"It seems that in some jurisdictions, there is more debris in the streets and in alleys than in others. So there may be some weaknesses in sanitation. I think that whoever is the councilperson in that district should put pressure on that agency to improve the face of the community.</p>",

Our Mayor as well as our Baltimore City delegation are making the right steps to craft legislation to improve police-community relations.</p>",
    "q3":"The lessons we learned from Freddie Grey is that we need to invest in our community as well as mend police and the community relations. By ensuring that residents have access to and are ready for jobs we can reduce crime in our community. Ensuring communities trust the police department is also critical. We should focus not on the destruction, but the energy that communities had in coming together to clean up. We need to harness this energy to help build a better Baltimore.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore cannot make a meaningful cut in its property tax rate without expanding its tax base. Before we expand the tax base any cuts will hurt our most disadvantaged neighbors and programs for seniors and youth. Currently, Baltimore City Schools are not getting their fair share in education funding because of Tax Increment Funding. The formula currently recognizes the increased property values in TIF areas, and assumes that the city is realizing the financial benefits of the increase. However, the increased value is going toward paying off TIF bonds. I would advocate for legislation that recognizes the issues, and ensures that Baltimore is getting its share in education funding. TIFs and PILOTs must be used to help development throughout Baltimore, not just in the neighborhoods around the waterfront.</p>",
    "q5":"As the next City Councilperson I would act as a liaison between the developers and the neighborhoods to ensure that projects are investments in the community and help benefit my neighbors without displacing them. Vacants to Values has not had an impact on the 13 District. I welcome Governor Hogan's recent announcement to remove blight from District 13.</p>",
    "q6":"While there are plenty of jobs in District 13 and throughout the City of Baltimore, job readiness and job accessibility are some of the biggest barriers. Using Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) and Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) ensures Baltimore City residents are working on Baltimore City projects, and that Baltimore City residents earn fair wages and that projects are investments in communities.</p>",

    "q8":"The council could always do more to address lead paint poison, homelessness and crime and community relations. The Council has passed 'Ban the Box,' they have dedicated 3% of the budget to youth programs, and there was legislation that did not pass to grade restaurant cleanliness.</p>",
    "q9":"While it is easier than ever to report problems in the city through calling 311, the 311 app, and reporting it online, the problems are still not being addressed by the City. Ensuring that residents concerns are being addressed and not ignored is an important step in addressing quality of life issues. Regular financial and performance audits of agencies will begin to ensure that agencies are responding to residents concerns.</p>",

I am also open to a possible curfew.</p>",
    "q2":"I have confidence in the current police commissioner, who I believe should work, as he has attempted to, on community police relations.  Although, I am very critical of elected officials, who in certain circumstances have wrongfully accused police officers, many of whom, are more knowledgeable of the communities they patrol than the elected officials. See next question on how I would improve police-community relations.</p>",
    "q3":"Remembering the racial unrest that occurred in 1960s Baltimore, I know that this is a long-standing and complicated issue. Yet, I believe there have been successful initiatives that could be re-imagined for today’s Baltimore.  For instance, Republican Mayor, Theodore R. McKeldin had the Baltimore city police place store-front offices in the neighborhoods where dissatisfaction and unrest were at their worst.  The storefronts allowed police departments to discuss issues. directly with citizens and the community.  Furthermore, McKeldin deployed portable playgrounds into neighborhoods, and kept swimming pools and fire hydrants open past normal hours.</p><p>As a footnote: Because of his success, governor McKeldin was appoint by President Johnson to take charge of Washington DC, which at the time had far more severe difficulties, and he was later praised by then Vice-President Hubert Humphrey as being successful in Washington as well.</p>",
    "q4":"Property taxes should be reduced; however the current budget cannot endure to give up much income.  I say yes because reducing taxes would lead to a needed cosmetic improvement, in that it would attract new residents and renewal.</p><P>Generally, I believe incentives to encourage development are positive and our real estate values around the Harbor reflect their input.  I also see positive results in the four to five thousand apartment units that have been added in downtown Mt. Vernon and Station North, which as I understand have a 94% occupation rate and rising.</p>",
    "q5":"First of all, Governor Hogan has, and will continue to travel around the country, and the world, to bring manufacturing to Baltimore, which can be achieved through tax credits and incentives.  A lack of these incentives has driven companies away from Baltimore.  That trend must be reversed. </P><p>Secondly, there are opportunities for improvement, such as in the area of Reistertown rd between Park Circle and Belvedere where salvageable vacant houses should be offered for a dollar in return for committed ownership for 5-7 years.  </p>",
    "q6":"Unemployment caused by the lack of blue-collar jobs must be addressed by our educational system as well as elected leadership. Private businesses need to be welcomed to Baltimore, on a permanent basis, possibly through tax incentives and other accommodations. </p>",
    "q7":"No, the balance of power is inappropriate, but more importantly, future mayors should not be using Ravens and Oriole tickets to get city council members to vote for, or against, certain bills.  That in itself has demeaned the relationship.  There should be civil discourse at all times, to come to reasonable conclusions of the extremely complicated problems that occur in modern day Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q8":"Again I reiterate, the proper issues have not been dealt with, such as police and community relations, which is as much the responsibility of the city council as it is the Mayors office, and I have perceived it has been largely been ignored.</p><p>Furthermore, fatherless children, and difficulties of disadvantaged youth should be investigated by a committee appointed by the city council, and that I consider salient to the future of Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q9":"Months ago a robbery attempt occurred as I was leaving the downtown Basilica. A man came up to my car and demanded my money. I called the police, who never came.  Recruitment must be enhanced, as it was in with successful results in the 1970s, in order to return our police department to full force.</p><p>Though there is work being committed to some of our streets, I have never seen this level of disrepair in our infrastructure, which is the fault of the public works and the Mayor’s office.  Because the present Mayor’s cut backs on the amount of meter readers in the Baltimore city, millions of dollars were never collected, and outrageous errors have occurred in utility billing, causing the most vulnerable to be overcharged hundreds of dollars.  The water department needs to be adequately staffed and our city services made a priority.</p><p>Lastly, the current Mayoral administration has tried to encourage undocumented immigrants to live in Baltimore, and though I appreciate the compassion, many of our less fortunate citizens have been deprived of jobs and education because of the funds allocated toward this effort. We must take of our own citizens.</p>",
    "q10":"As a life-long city resident, I’ve become deeply concerned with the repetition of long term problems, such as with poor accounting procedures, and with a board of education, which continues to lose money and does not have an effective product. In that, violence against teachers and students persists and though the number of highschool graduates has increased, the grades on achievement tests have stayed low, preventing opportunities that those students should enjoy.</p><P>Secondly, I have deep concerns regarding our unrepaired streets, as well as other infrastructure, including our water department, which has had tremendously difficulty with miscalculating bills for residents, the city, and all parts of Baltimore County.</P><P>In final, excessive homicides and drug use continue to be a major problem throughout the city, along with fatherless homes and a disconnect between the police department and citizens, which should be thoughtfully addressed.</p>"

    "q1":"The 14th Council District is diverse, creative, and caring. Breaking the current cycle of crime in our neighborhoods is the primary demand and requirement in these times, whatever the neighborhood --- but especially where the crime is violent and the neighbors enveloped in its culture, climate, and heartbreaks. </p><p>It is my responsibility to ensure that the officers leading our local police districts are effective, responsive and caring. I am constantly in touch with them and attest that, in Eastern, Northeast, and Northern Police Districts, our commanders are striving to meet our demanding standards for their work and consistently encouraging their officers to likewise serve as our communities expect and deserve. </p><p>Other pressing issues in our district include:</p><p>- the expectation of good schools and ample opportunities for our youth; </p><p>- safer pedestrian walkways and street crossings, especially near schools, playgrounds, and senior buildings; </p><p>- traffic calming on all our neighborhood streets as a pro-active citywide policy; </p><p>- clean streets, alleys, neighborhoods;</p><p>- Community notice and engagement in the planning of new developments and institutional expansions; and,</p><p>- Snow removal plans that neighbors can understand, track and affect in real time.</p>",
    "q2":"I have confidence in the Police Department's current leadership. Commissioner Kevin Davis impresses me as a respected professional who understands the urgency to bring stability, accountability, and morale to the department. </p><p>Most impressively, Commissioner Davis has demonstrated his respect for our citizens and neighborhoods. The department's 14th District command staffs are professional, effective, and community-responsive. We hear from them, they listen to us, and bonds are forming at that level. </p><p>The challenge is to bridge the gaps between communities and the many frontline officers who see us only at our 911 worst. One solution often suggested is restoration of the Police Athletic League (PAL) through which frontline officers ran popular recreation programs for neighborhood children and youth. </p><p>Those younger officers loved their PAL roles, despite lacking the supplies and budgets they needed to sustain the program. But PAL is worth repeating as a bridge-builder at the grassroots level of neighborhoods and the department. For starters, let's try adequate funding for one pilot per City Council district.</p>",
    "q3":"The Freddie Gray lesson is that we must better serve our children and youth, especially the thousands raised by good families in poverty surroundings, hundreds of whom are disabled by the lead paint poisoning in the only homes their families can afford. To better serve requires affordable and decent housing growing up, special education resources, mentors and job opportunities instead of defaults to drug market competing outside the front door. </p><p>As to the peaceful protests, they were overdue and will hopefully lead to radical changes in how Baltimore cares for its families and children and in how our police department treats and regards the citizens it is sworn to serve and protect. As for the unrest, it should be remembered as of one day's duration, invaded by looters who disgraced themselves and us all before the world, and as followed by a sweeping-up by neighbors and an outpouring of help from all quarters, ongoing to this day.</p>",
    "q4":"Even granted narrowly for only owner-occupied residential properties, the individual property savings from the mayor's local tax credits or from potential property tax rate reductions bring minimal relief to individual tax bills compared to the major negative toll such losses take on a city government faced with urgent fiscal obligations, from promised new recreation centers to full implementation of police body cameras. </p><p>As for tax incentives, Baltimore has reached the point of needing to decide, \"What's the plan?\" Our rising assessable base makes us too wealthy for the State education funds we require, but tax incentives leave us too \"cash poor\" to afford the loss. The time has come to narrow the scope of consideration for such tax advantages to what \"the plan\" will determine are the essentials for Baltimore's successful future. </p><p>Perhaps those essentials include developments offering decent fulltime jobs to which city residents have affordable and reliable transportation and the chance of being hired. And perhaps mixed-income housing to which our low-and-moderate income families can relocate from lead infected rental units. We need that planning context as prelude to deciding the cost-effective incentives we can afford if we are to attract what the city needs, not simply react to what the next developer proposes. </p>",
    "q5":"Success follows success. In the 14th District, private sector commercial and residential revitalization is significant, but it is concentrated in specific parts of the district and lacking in others. I often wish we could wave a wand to equalize the distribution. </p><p>Except for highly subsidized exceptions, the racial demographics of a neighborhood play a disproportionate role in private development decision-making. In commercial areas, the perceived safety and sanitation are deciding factors for investment. </p><p>Developers in overlooked residential neighborhoods are typically single rowhouse investors rehabbing for absentee rental, a source of frustration to neighborhood leaders seeking affordable homeownership options. Affordable homeownership is where public investment can make the most difference to overlooked neighborhoods, providing incentives to tip the scale in favor of restored stability.</p><p>We thank Governor Hogan for his announced effort to provide demolition funding to eliminate blight in Baltimore neighborhoods. We hope that a share of this funding will be invested in finishing the multi-year relocation and clearing of a 3-block area in the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello neighborhood called the \"Tivoly Triangle.\" We invite him to be our guest in seeing and envisioning the potential. </p>",
    "q6":"A skilled, trained, and available employee base will attract new economic development to Baltimore and encourage the expansion of existing employment centers. In recent years, Baltimore has succeeded in retaining more young college graduates as city residents than in the recent past. The special arts districts deserve a share of credit for this millennial population boom, both within these districts and in nearby neighborhoods. </p><p>The challenge in building upon this promising base, however, is to educate, train, and promote our home-grown public school students as the magnets for economic development in every field of endeavor, from STEM to STEAM. Hopkins School of Engineering is already equipping and training Barclay School students in state of the art technology for 21st century careers. Robotics clubs and courses are cropping-up across the school system. If we focus on such successes as trendsetters and engage our colleges and universities in tailoring higher education tracks for our students, our homegrown graduates will become the talent pool that promotes Baltimore as \"the place\" to locate and recruit.</p>",
    "q7":"With power comes accountability. I have long supported the \"strong mayor\" form of city government, because it ensures specific accountability for how the city spends our taxes. </p><p>In the current structure, the mayor controls 3 votes on the 5-member Board of Estimates which controls the city budget. The Board is chaired by the President of the City Council, and the City Comptroller is a member, both voting as independent elected officials. The Mayor's 3 votes are her own and those of the other 2 members, both of whom she appoints to their paid positions as City Solicitor and Director of Public Works. The system is designed to guarantee a consistent mayoral majority.</p><p>This Board of Estimates originates the City's annual budget and approves it for introduction as an ordinance to the City Council. The City Council can approve, disapprove, or approve with cuts. Funding is often cut when City Council wants the funding used for a different purpose than proposed. The Council, however, does not have the power to transfer cut funds to that other purpose. Only the Board has that authority, and mayors usually refuse to make the requested transfer. In a stalemate, the cut funds must be used to cut the property tax.</p><p>Council's right to transfer its cuts is a change I might support, provided the budget's bottom line remains the same. </p>",
    "q8":"Let me focus on City Council's role in standing traditional budget making on its head by writing our children and youth into the pages of the city budget and working for steady annual increases until this priority comes into fiscal balance with other crucial services. </p><p>Since my 14th District election in 2004 and certainly in the past 4 years, the Baltimore City Council has been a leader in promoting the needs of Baltimore's children and youth and influencing the creation and annual growth of the city's children and youth budget as a focal point of annual city budget deliberations. </p><p>In 2014, City Council unanimously and successfully requested the addition of $4 million to the fiscal year 2016 budget for increases to after school, out of school, summer school, and community school programs. In January 2016, City Council adopted a proposed Charter amendment requiring a 3% dedication of annual general funds to children and youth, a jump-start on meeting our obligations to Baltimore's future. </p><p>Of all the diverse and \"right issues\" addressed in Council's 2011-2016 term of office, writing children and youth into the budget and persisting in that budget's annual growth have been the most enduring and \"rightest\" from my perspective.</p>",
    "q9":"CitiStat is on the mend but needs restoration as a reliable tool for agency assessment and accountability on a regular schedule, with city leaders involved, and solutions to failed responses discussed for better outcomes going forward. CitiStat is 311's accountability tool as well, connecting constituent input to agency response. CitiStat has also served to convene diverse stakeholders on specific public issues and assess steps to resolve complex issues such as legal barriers to effective domestic violence prosecution. Restoring the CitiStat function to its proper oversight role will improve response time and resident satisfaction, because, like all of us, --- as with this questionnaire --- we work hardest when reporting deadlines loom.</p>",
    "q10":"I \"came of age\" in Baltimore in the aftermath of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the riots that followed. As neophyte community and political activists and amidst a quietude of City political leadership, hundreds of us found each other and joined forces to help rebuild a fairer and more united Baltimore from the neighborhoods up. With a new City Council, I hope to share that life-changing experience of positive outcomes from devastating setbacks and my confidence in the power of our citizenry to effect changes that matter for the better. This era is one not to miss for the wonders it can bring. </p>"

   "q1": "The number one problem is a lack of decent jobs. The city hands over hundreds of millions of dollars to Paterakis, Angelos, UnderArmour. And at the same time, thousands of city jobs have been eliminated. Use that money to restore those jobs and add more. Hire massively into the schools, the libraries, and city services. If people have jobs, they have money to spend. City jobs could be an engine for further job growth.</p>",
   "q2": "In too many cases, it's the police themselves who are the perpetrators of violent crime. Freddie Gray was just the tip of the iceberg. What is called violent crime is directly linked with the lack of jobs and opportunities for young people. I think it's a \"violent crime\" that so many are thrown into prison, without any chance for a decent future.</p>",
   "q3": "The \"War on Drugs\" is a pretext to throw people in prison for the \"crime\" of being young and black. But nothing changes without a fight. I think it's obvious there would have been no trials, and no large pay-out to the family, if young black people hadn't come out in the streets.</p>",
   "q4": "It's an outrage that a single cent of our tax money goes to billionaire developers. If TIF's and PILOT's worked the way politicians promise, the city would be swimming in jobs. They don't work – except for the developers. Those hundreds of millions of dollars could be used instead to fix the roads, sewers and bridges, repair the schools, re-open the recreation centers, and train people to do this work.</p>",
   "q5": "\"Revitalization\"? I find it disgusting that when working class families, mostly black, are pushed out of their homes -- and wealthier, mostly white families move in -- it's called \"revitalizing\" the neighborhood. There's a dire need for affordable housing all over the city. They've already built publicly-subsidized housing – for the very wealthy! All of the proposed luxury condos at Harbor Point will be taxpayer funded. I can't stop the normal business deals on my own. But I would use the city council office to make the business deals known and understandable for the public.</p>",
   "q6": "The city has been losing thousands of jobs as the big private companies shut down. No company should be allowed to lay off a single worker, or shut down a workplace, while they are making a profit. If they claim they are broke, let them open their books to the workers.</p>",
   "q7": "I'm not interested in the squabbles between the Democratic mayor and the Democratic city council. It's the Democratic Party that has helped to carry out the attacks leading to our declining standard of living.

Baltimore needs to join the many other cities who have committed to raise workers' wages. Low wages and part time work are one of the major causes of poverty in Baltimore. Many of our largest institutions, including hospitals, banks, and much of the hospitality services pay less than a livable wage. Let's make Baltimore a sweatshop free zone, guarantee worker's rights including the right to join a union and pay a livable wage.</p>",
   "q2": "My campaign views the current epidemic of drug addiction and violence as a health crisis. We advocate for the need to develop community based health centers like the model of the east Baltimore Men's and Family Center which provides holistic care. </p><p>Community centered clinics and crisis centers must administer not only to people's physical health but also mental health, including violence prevention especially among youth. These centers must be free and accessible to all.</p><p>Our city ranks in the top 5 cities in terms of the number of police per person, which illustrates that more police and police repression have failed to solve the problem of crime or violence. </p><p>We contend that the way forward is making youth come first in this city which means better educational opportunities, jobs for all, lead free housing, ending poverty in our city, and most of all bringing hope and unity to our communities. In every instance, it is the poor who suffer the greatest from violence in our community.</p><p>The call for more police and the consequent militarization of police departments feels good to many politicians, and so the police budget goes up and up while education and services to the people go down. It also seems the only solution to grasp for when people in our city have so very little control over their day to day existence and the environment around them.</p>",
   "q3": "Baltimore needs to end racism and police terror. We need to disarm and disband racist police, and instead build Peoples Peace Patrols based on the Black Panther Party model that can protect and serve our communities. In the interim, we call for a fully elected Peoples Board to control and regulate police, with the ability to hire and fire police. We will hold quarterly \"Peoples Assemblies\" to allow the community to speak out about abuses and have control and oversight on police policies and procedures. The city must protect the people.</p><p>On the issue of racism: we must end the disparity between communities, in Upton and Druid Heights the life expectancy is only 63 years old compared to Roland Park which is 83 years old. This is just one illustration of the disparities that exist in our city between black and white, between rich and poor. </p><p>Baltimore City needs to lead the way in taking a clear political position on reparations for the descendants of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Once that's done, we need to figure out how to concretely do it! </p><p>We need to strive to make Baltimore a city where all forms of bigotry are combated. Black lives matter in Baltimore! Let's tell ICE hands off, that immigrant families are welcome. Let's make sure that all people can feel secure including Muslims, transgender people, the LGBT community, and women.</p>",
   "q4": "Our campaign has a simple message on taxes: tax the rich, not the poor. Property taxes need to be reduced for working people, seniors, and the poor. How can it be fair for older home owners living on fixed incomes, who have seen their neighborhoods gentrified and taxes increased, to now face the sad likely hood of being pushed out of their own homes? On the other hand, the city must look at closing tax loopholes for bankers, builders, and contractors who too often take more than they give.</p>",
   "q5": "We need jobs, not jails. The trickle-down theory of giving money to big businesses through tax breaks and favors so that ultimately they will provide jobs is a failed strategy. We will enact a \"Works Progress Administration\" style jobs program designed to rebuild Baltimore's crumbling infrastructure and its communities, much like the programs enacted after the Great Depression.</p><p>A citywide jobs program would hire youth to plant trees and refurbish our green spaces, build safe bike lanes, promote free mass transit, convert abandoned lots into vegetable gardens which can feed the people healthy food, hire additional teachers to aid in our over-crowded schools, hire men and women to work in recreations centers.</p><p>The city would have full power to end all forms of discrimination in these programs, pay a livable wage, and give those convicted in the criminal \"injustice system\" a second chance.</p>",
   "q6": "Policies and priorities are the chief barriers to economic development, real job creation, and serious investment in people. Governor Hogan's unilateral decision to spend $480 million to build a new jail complex, while cutting funding for education, is just one example.</p><p>Our campaign on the other hand believes Baltimore's housing crisis can lend itself to innovative solutions. </p><p>We would end the slum conditions in our public housing projects by hiring additional workers to make the massive repairs and forming a worker's cooperative based on training and hiring public housing residents themselves to make public housing livable. </p><p>On an even larger scale, we would address the blight of abandoned housing by creating massive job opportunities to saving housing where possible and demolishing where necessary. Included in this project, would be the enactment of a program of sweat equity where the homeless and those who lack adequate decent housing could own their homes by participating where they are able to, in rebuilding abandoned housing. </p><p>We support Community Land Trusts.</p>",
   "q7": "Members of city council especially the president need to become leaders rather than politicians; this means challenging the status-quo when necessary. It means overriding the mayor and fighting on every level possible to represent the people. </p><p>We believe the present power structure has failed the people - abandoned buildings, joblessness, lack of hope and despair abound. In many ways the present system has kicked democracy to the curb. We pledge to empower people by holding quarterly Peoples Assemblies, where people can have a voice in decisions. </p><p>In addition, we need to expand voting rights to all, including those imprisoned in our \"injustice\" system, and undocumented workers and their families. My campaign will fight to lower the voting age to 16 years to give our youth a voice.</p>",
   "q8": "The City Council must become more focused on fighting for relevant education for all children and youth. We need to end the disparity in funding between the richer counties in Maryland and Baltimore City. All children deserve a decent education which means not only more books but also state of the art buildings where students can actually drink from the water fountains without fear lead poisoning. </p><p>We would fight for an elected school board composed of teachers, students and parents accountable to the community; for hiring more teachers and teacher aides; and allowing youth a critical voice in their education. </p><p>We need to restore community based recreation centers and end the school to prison pipeline.</p>",
   "q9": "Heat, light and water are a right! Immediate halt to all shut-offs of utilities and water to families with young children, seniors, people with health problems and disabilities, the unemployed, and youth struggling to make ends meet. Enact a city owned peoples controlled utility to administer gas and electric in Baltimore to end BGE's monopoly. Roll back water rates to working class and poor residents, and collect from big businesses. Health care is another major need in our communities. Our campaign supports Medicare for all. There are a myriad of causes of poor health and so along with establishing community clinics, we need to end environmental pollution by shutting down polluters and converting to green energy as quickly as possible and combating the food deserts in west and east Baltimore by empowering community gardens.</p>",
   "q10": "We need a new vision for Baltimore where people come before banks and big businesses; a city free of all forms of racism and discrimination where Black lives matter; a city that values workers and the poor. The Baltimore Campaign for Peoples Power, which I am a part of, believes this is possible."

I would go to business owners and CEOs--both large and small--and find out what makes it difficult for them to operate in the city. I would interview business owners who have recently left or are planning to leave to find out why. My guess is they leave to escape high taxes, crumbling infrastructure (rough streets, traffic snarls, water main breaks and sink holes), and crime.</p>",
   "q2": "It is not evident that Baltimore has any strategy to reduce violent crime at this time. I do not feel confident in the Police Department's current leadership. It seems to be directionless. Police officers should be trained to take an \"innocent until proven guilty\" approach when dealing with the public. The department needs to commit to serving all city residents equally--there should be no neighborhoods where they do not go. A citizen review board could be tried--other cities have done this, notably New York. Some of the customer service techniques that are common in the private sector could be tried, such as following up with a satisfaction survey after each response to a call, or after randomly selected encounters with the public.</p>",
   "q3": "The death or injury of anyone in police custody is unacceptable, and should be investigated immediately, vigorously and transparently. There was at least one other case some years ago in which a man was dead upon arrival at the police station, not to mention the incidents of unarmed citizens being shot in the streets by police. That said, police should not let their embarrassment over the actions of a few cloud their understanding of what their responsibilities are. It was very disappointing to see the police standing by while businesses were being looted and burned.</p>",
   "q4": "The city should tax only location value, not improvements and structures on a property. This approach has revitalized a number of mid-sized cities in Pennsylvania. If it feels too radical to shift to zero taxation on improvements, it could be done incrementally, taxing improvements less and less until it gets down to zero, with all property tax placed on the location or land value. With tax increment funding, the city issues bonds to pay for infrastructure improvements required by new development, in the expectation that they will be repaid with an increase from associated property tax revenue. I am in favor of investing in repairing and maintaining existing infrastructure, not in providing what amounts to a subsidy to development corporations. If the property tax were based on location value only, payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) would be unnecessary, as new buildings and improvements would not create steep increases in property taxes.</p>",
   "q5": "I have read through Joan Jacobson's report to the Abell Foundation on the Vacants to Value program, and my conclusion is that this, and other similar programs, will be more effective in an environment in which property tax is based on location/land value and not on improvements to structures on the land. Families or investors rehabilitating homes in depressed neighborhoods would pay very little property tax and therefore have more resources available to renovate. Right now, when a resident fixes up his house, it is assessed at a higher value and his property tax goes up. I applaud the partnership between the Governor and the Mayor to attack the blight of vacant buildings in Baltimore, as it signals an improvement in their relationship over what it was at the time of the civil unrest sparked by the death of Freddie Gray.</p>",
   "q6": "Businesses, and with them, jobs, are leaving Baltimore City in droves. I live near the County line, and I can go into the city to shop and buy gas or go an equal distance into the County and pay about 5 cents a gallon less for gas and shop more conveniently due to the existence of parking. For starters, we need to eliminate any taxes that burden only City residents, such as the bottle tax and the snack tax. Any regulations that make it more difficult to do business in the City than in nearby areas should also be eliminated. The City needs to aspire to be at least on a par with the surrounding counties when it comes to street maintenance, snow and trash removal, and other such services.</p>",
   "q7": "Some years ago, voters passed a new city charter that gave the Mayor almost absolute power. The School Superintendent, for example, was said in the charter to \"serve at the Mayor's pleasure.\" I believe this was unfortunate, but I don't see any political momentum building to change this, and I don't intend to expend any effort of my own on it. The lack of autonomy of the City vis-à-vis the State government is much more serious. Neither the Mayor nor the City Council have power to govern the city in the areas that really matter. Decisions on everything from policing to the City's tax structure are made in Annapolis.</p>",
   "q8": "The enormity of the City's problems and the lack of any legal power to do much about them has bred a spirit of defeatism in the City Council, in my observation. The Council focuses on things, however petty or irrelevant, that it can control, such as increasing the fine for public urination or banning crossbows.</p>",
   "q9": "City government should apply the customer service approaches practiced by businesses in the private sector that have to satisfy their customers to survive. Create customer satisfaction surveys on police, fire and ambulance response, trash collection, snow removal, etc. Breakdowns are most likely to occur wherever one agency has to interface with another. A prisoner is given an assessment for placement in a drug treatment program, but the Public Defender's office is unable to get a copy of the report from the Department of Behavioral Health to place it in front of the judge, so his court hearing is postponed multiple times and he remains incarcerated for 9, 10, 11 months without trial. Schools and libraries wait for their work orders to make their way through the DPW instead of just calling someone to come fix their roofs or their toilets.</p>",

TIFs and PILOTs wouldn't be so detrimental if we were able to introduce and enforce clauses that require the recipient to hire locally, hire minority workers, buy locally, and benefit the community by contributing to youth centers or parks.

    "q1":"As a candidate for Baltimore City Council President I am running city-wide. Most, not all, but most of the problems in Baltimore City can be significantly reduced if you look at the root which comes down to two things: economics and education.</p><p>1. Hunger- Baltimore is one of a half dozen or so major urban cities plagued by food deserts. Maryland Senate bill 541 authorizes a food desert tax incentive to attract and retain supermarket in \"retail incentive\" areas throughout the city. If you combine this with growing co-ops and supermarket co-operatives like some other cities with similar issues. Baltimore needs a program like Cincinnati, Ohio's \"Grocery Attraction Pilot Program\"</p><p>2. Homelessness - For the \"economically homeless\" Use the already existing legislation to re-purpose state and city owned properties. Make it a three tier system. The first tier is temporary during individual assessment. Create an individual action plan including both educational and economic options. The second tier implement the individual plan which will include but not be limited to vocational and trade opportunities, move from temporary housing to semi-permanent housing. The third tier is after successfully completing the individual action plan, including financial literacy is to be given the opportunity to own an income based co-op housing unit with all the rights and privileges of home ownership.</p>",

Require Baltimore City officers to live in Baltimore City.</p><p>3. Police and Community training and pairing for the purpose of creating a Neighborhood Watch in every neighborhood.</p><p>4. Reassessment of necessary resources to decrease the rate of unresolved homicides. Invite in and collaborate with the numerous organizations like \"Open Heart /Close Case Campaign\" which has a network of active and retired multi agency agents and detectives in some cases willing to VOLUNTEER their services in high crime rate areas.</p><p>5. Fix the procedure and process for reporting and finding missing children. I was personally involved in helping a father find his missing fourteen year old daughter. The father was lead to believe he had to wait 48 hours to file a report which he finally did, even though the child was last known to be in the company and car of someone not authorized. There was no Amber Alert, and six days after he notified the school his child was missing they called him a day AFTER she had come to the school saying \"oops\". The system is broken.</p><p>6. I would encourage city wide support of both National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day in January and Police Week in May to acknowledge those officers that consistently go above and beyond for our city.</p>",

Not just of the perceived racial bias but a whole host of ills including un and under employment, high crime, poorly performing schools, sub standard housing ... The death of Freddy Gray was a tipping point for Baltimore. When you look at cases like Tyrone West and even cases like Officer William Torbit and hear phrases like vestiges of segregation, gentrification, and Institutional Racism it is very difficult to argue racism. However, the city of Baltimore has a bigger problem as evidenced by the prevalence of Black on Black crime shown by last years homicide rate and statistics. Classicism leading to a downward spiral of self-loathing and hopelessness manifesting in senseless acts against ones own. Unless we as a city correct the root issues as I outlined earlier we will continue to say Baltimore doesn't have a war on poverty, Baltimore has a war against the poor. Baltimore is now and has been a city where the \"minority\" is the majority. You don't find \"issues\" in the Black neighborhoods, we as Black people are everywhere in this city. You find the \"issues\" in the predominately Black neighborhoods where the \"POOR\" people are. You don't find lead in the pipes in the schools in Roland Park, there is money there. You don't find drug dealers on the corner there, people have jobs. Fix the root, economics and education. People need hope in the form of a viable and sustainable way out.</p>",
    "q4":"As Baltimore City Council President I would look to see a moratorium on any new or increased taxes until we can get a compete city audit. Taxes are levied as a way for Baltimore to afford the cost of necessary services. Without a complete audit, both performance and fiscal any financial decisions are nothing more than a guess. If we audit and get rid of waste. If we audit and get rid of fraud, we might be able to close the projected 75 million dollar budget gap the Mayor spoke of and fund more youth initiatives without a City Charter amendment like the current City Council President is pushing for. The city of Baltimore needs good solid fiscal stewardship, something it hasn't had in maybe a good 20 years. We as the residents of Baltimore deserve better than that.</p>",
    "q5":"In terms of neighborhood revitalization in neighborhoods away from the water you have to fix the neighborhood key indicators, in other words all the issues that help property value maintain or increase. You get crime down, education up, improve transportation access, increase curb appeal, offer incentives to neighborhood businesses and bring in jobs that stay in the community. In terms of Vacants to Value, I have seen very little value. Lastly it is a sad state of affairs when the state governor once again must rescue a city ravaged and plagued for decades by a one party political machine from its own devices and short sighted policies.</p>",
    "q6":"According to the Greater Baltimore Committee the chief economic barriers to Baltimore city economic development beaks down into four categories.</p><p>- Economic regulation: restrictions on the way businesses can operate, what products and services they can produce and how and where they produce them, price them and market them to consumers</p><p>- Environmental regulation: the costs of complying with environmental statutes</p><p>- Tax compliance regulation: the so-called \"paperwork burden\" costs associated with time and resources required to comply with tax regulations</p><p>- Occupational safety and health regulation: the costs of complying with labor-related laws</p><p>This is important for a few reasons. Sometimes you have to step outside to see in. The best way to address the issues with regards economic development and job creation is not to legislate your way out but listen. In the course of my campaign I recent had the pleasure of meeting a Fell's Point business owner who has been a fixture in Fells Point for over 30 years. He spoke of being frustrated with Baltimore and being just about ready to sell everything and leave. He already no longer lives in the city. We talked for a good hour after the event. From that I made a suggestion that will help him and this city. The business owner asked me not to mention his name quite yet. Stay tuned for a big announcement from Fell's Point within the next few weeks. Sometimes the best way to remove barriers is to listen.</p>",
    "q7":"The structure of city governance is irrelevant without appropriate clear and transparent leadership. As residents of the city of Baltimore, it is incumbent of all of us to do our due diligence in electing leaders. The governance of this great city, state, and country as a whole was created with a system of checks and balances to keep a balance of power. Rather than re-writing as a whole, or amending in part this cities charter we should put in our due diligence in whom we elect and demanding enforcement of the already existing safeguards in place.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council was focused on the right issues. When asked what were the most important issues the Baltimore city Council has faced in the last four years the only two issues that came to mind were the Casino and the charter amendment in 2012. You tell me, is that good or bad.</p>",
    "q9":"To use a recent example, the city's response to the recent blizzard showed more than weakness. The cites response showed borderline criminal neglect. In Baltimore county residents were given clear time lines and a recourse if there particular street wasn't cleared. No such luck in Baltimore City. You would be hard pressed to find a city where every resident is happy with everything but Baltimore is far from that. During one of the Mayor numerous press conferences someone spoke of a cost of $40,000 an hour to clear the roads. Once again familiar is this theme; a performance audit most residents would say that was not money well spent. Baltimore City has many public service issues and is ill prepared for an emergency of any type whether it be water, sewer, power, or weather. Our city's aging and crumbling infrastructure make it nearly impossible to handle emergencies in a timely manner. We didn't get this way overnight and it won't get fixed overnight. Response time is going to take a team effort. Resident satisfaction however can be drastically improved now with some truth, transparency, and realistic expectations all of which currently seem to be in short supply.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for Baltimore City Council President to put the charm back in \"Charm City\". Last year's murder rate in the City of Baltimore was not charming. The growing rate of homelessness in Baltimore City is not charming. The lack of educational and economic opportunities in Baltimore City is not charming. I am running for the office of Baltimore City Council President to put real, viable, and sustainable options and opportunities on the table for all Baltimore residents. This city and the residents of Baltimore deserve this city to be a city of inclusion not exclusion and collusion. I am running to bring transparency to government through sound fiscal stewardship and complete and consistent audits. I pledge to empower communities with the resources to redesign their individual communities based on the needs of the residents, and educational opportunities so that all of our children can compete in a global market.</p>"

    "q1":"As an elected official representing a citywide office, I have the pleasure of working toward solutions that benefit citizens across districts and throughout Baltimore. I believe that we have a unique opportunity to build on the successes that we've accomplished during the past several years, and as a result leave a better Baltimore for our younger citizens to inhabit.</p><p>We will be able to accomplish this vision by better preparing our children educationally. The first step toward accomplishing this goal begins with Baltimore City re-establishing full control over its public school system. Doing so, in my opinion, would allow the City Council to hold accountable public school leadership and quickly adjust to changes in the educational needs of our children.</p>",
    "q2":"The strategies to combat Baltimore's violent crime do not begin with our police department. That way of thinking is reactive to the situation instead of proactive. When it comes to violent crime, our best option for reducing the numbers is to start with decreasing the number of citizens that turn to violence. This means early childhood education programs, after-school and recreational programming, adequate college preparation, job training and job creation. These are the elements that lead people down a path of success and prosperity and away from a life of violent crime and our city can and must do more to invest in these opportunities. Our police department is going through a transformation and we must allow time for changes to be implemented and leadership to take action before making assumptions about their effectiveness. As Council President, I would invest in improving our police and community relations through collaborative events, increased foot patrol, and providing incentives for our officers to live in Baltimore and in the neighborhoods they serve. Our police force must think of Baltimore as their home in order to serve the population with the utmost respect and responsibility.</p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray, Jr. was a horrible tragedy. But out of that tragedy, a catalyst for change was born. The riots that devastated our city also brought us together in the realization that the residents in our most vulnerable neighborhoods need our support and investment. The events in April also led to a change in leadership of our Baltimore Police Department and a federal investigation of their policies and practices. In the short amount of time since these changes, we've already seen efforts on the part of the police to connect with the community and the termination of officers that have track records of unacceptable behavior. Baltimore is just one of many cities experiencing a wave of change as the discussion of race and equality takes place. We must use this moment to turn our attention and resources toward our citizens who are most in need.</p>",
    "q4":"The tax rate in Baltimore City is discouraging people from moving to Baltimore and crushing our residents financially. Of course taxes are necessary for a city to function. But there is no reason why our taxes should be almost double in comparison to our neighboring counties. I truly believe we need to make lowering the property tax rate in Baltimore City a priority. Tax incentives to encourage development are also necessary to raise the value of surrounding property, entice people to move to the city, and create jobs for our residents to take advantage of. But with these incentives, we must ensure that these businesses are giving back by committing to abiding by my landmark Local Hiring Law, renovating or building in the surrounding areas, and targeting their development in the neighborhoods that need local businesses.</p>",
    "q5":"We can encourage commercial and residential revitalization by requiring the developers that receive a tax incentive to commit real dollars toward community impact agreements and to providing affordable units for rent. We must also offer incentives for business to job train and hire local, including city government. Vacants to Value is a program that is steadily working on eliminating blight in the city and transforming neighborhoods. But it's a program that needs more financial power behind it. I am strongly encouraged by Governor Hogan's willingness to invest in the program. The combination of incentivizing residents and businesses to live and build in our vulnerable neighborhoods, hiring local, and rehabilitating or eliminating vacant homes prescription Baltimore needs to transform itself.</p>",
    "q6":"Baltimore is one of many cities that has struggled to make the transition from an industrial-based workforce to a technology-based workforce. The cycle of poverty and unemployment has impacted our city tremendously. This is why it is more important than ever for government to ensure that job training and job opportunities are available for residents. One way I've done that is through my successful Local Hire Ordinance requiring new city contracts to meet a local hire threshold. But we also have to get the strong private sector in Baltimore on board. This can be done by making arrangements with developments receiving a Tax Increment Financing deal in Baltimore to hire local and invest in our vulnerable and emerging neighborhoods. We also have to invest more in our youth to ensure they are ready for the 21st century job market through after-school programs, high-tech recreational centers, and summer job creation. It is my hope that my Children and Youth Fund will be a catalyst for such change.</p>",
    "q7":"The relationship between the Mayor and the City Council in Baltimore is a constant balancing act. On its face, Baltimore looks like a Mayoral dominated government. But when the City Council can work together and come to a consensus, we are able to be just as strong. I believe that if the Council could override a mayoral veto of a bill with a majority vote instead of a supermajority vote as it stands today, we would be able to pass more legislation and make a greater impact in the city. I also believe that if the members of the Board of Estimates were given equal voting power, the mayor would no longer have the final say about city contracts. Instead, the City Council President, Comptroller, and Mayor would vote equally as members of the board. At the end of the day, it is vital that the mayor and city council communicate and maintain a relationship of respect and openness to successfully serve the citizens of Baltimore.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council is the voice of the residents of Baltimore. No issue that passes through the council is less important than the next because they affect the daily lives of the residents we serve. In the last four years the city council has made lasting changes to Baltimore City including the Local Hire Ordinance, which requires businesses with new city contracts to meet a local hire threshold, the Body Camera Bill, which will outfit all Baltimore City police officers with a body-worn recording device, and most recently the Children and Youth Fund bill which would designate three percent of the general fund annually to children and youth programs in the city.</p>",
    "q9":"Efficient city services are vital for our residents because it impacts the daily quality of their lives. On a regular basis, thousands of requests come in to our 311 system from pothole repairs to gas leaks and everything in between. The best way to decrease response time for these requests is to constantly update the technology that citizens and city workers use to communicate with each other. The 311 mobile app makes a huge difference for our city workers by providing them with exact locations and photographic evidence in an immediate way. But issues, like multiple requests and responding to those requests when a problem is remedied, still exist. Investing in the latest technology, adequately training our employees, and ensuring the proper number of employees to complete the many requests that come in are just a few ways to improve city services. I like to think of my office as the go-to resource for constituent services. From connecting residents to the proper agency to driving out to a location myself - customer service is first and foremost on my radar as Council President.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for re-election because I would like to continue working to improve the lives of Baltimore's most challenged citizens and help provide them with the resources to improve their lives and strengthen the communities where we live, work and play.</p>"
