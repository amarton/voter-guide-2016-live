Veolia, a French corporation that operates in Maryland, sued Egypt over a new law to raise its minimum wage. We cannot allow transnational corporations to exploit workers. Baltimore has been hurt enough by agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement that cost us our steel industry. We cannot trade away our rights. All of our trade agreements have worsened the trade deficit, rather than helping. They enrich those at the top and hurt smaller businesses and farms.

A first step would be to look at the reality of the cost of living and raise the federal poverty level to reflect this. There should be a federal minimum wage that is tied to the cost of living in each area and that rises with inflation. Workers should be able to earn a living wage and have paid sick and family leave as well as vacation time. Families have emergencies and workers should not have to fear losing their job when they need time to deal with those emergencies. When workers are sick, they should be able to stay home and recover, especially when they have contagious illnesses. Families need time for recreation in order to be healthy. I would go even farther than a minimum wage to work towards a guaranteed basic income for all people. Instead of public dollars being used to subsidize the profits of big industries, those dollars should be viewed as a public investment with a public return similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund.

This should include how to store guns so that children do not have easy access to them. And there should be mandatory reporting of gun thefts to law enforcement.

I believe the agreement fails to provide enough safeguards to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.  Last year while the Iran deal was being crafted, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, even said, \"The Americans say they stopped Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They know it's not true.\" Cutting deals with our enemy puts America and our allies at risk. The deal releases billions of dollars to the Iranians. Even the current administration believes that some of the money will end up in hands of terrorist groups. Can you believe that? We would be assisting our enemies by funding their attacks.

The terrorist group ISIS presents a serious threat to the United States and its allies and must be destroyed.  The US foreign policy in the Middle East has left our traditional allies doubting US resolve.  Our hasty drawdown contributed to the rise of ISIS.  The current policies are clearly not working as ISIS continues to overtake territories and impose horrible human rights atrocities.  Without a clear plan that includes our international allies, I would not support putting our men and women of the United States military on the ground.

President Obama's goal was to expand access to insurance and make it more affordable - goals a vast majority of Marylanders support. Instead of reaching across the aisle and finding bipartisan solutions; the Affordable Care Act was rushed through Congress and the result has been pain for Maryland families.  Premiums and deductibles are rising.  Individuals have been thrown off their health insurance plans and many are no longer able to keep their doctors.

Local community banks are struggling as a result of the increased regulations.  While we need to regulate big Wall Street banks who were the bad actors; we need to make sure community banks, who know their local communities, are protected.
