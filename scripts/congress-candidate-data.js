    "q1":"This was a poorly negotiated agreement that had no realistic chance of succeeding, with a country that already had a reputation of violating such agreements. It is no surprise that they have already violated the prohibition on ballistic missile testing. That's why I voted against the agreement, and believe we should immediately \"snap back\" sanctions.</p>",
    "q2":"We should consider a declaration of war on ISIS. They have promised our destruction. SInce they have already declared themselves as a caliphate - a nation-state - we should form a coalition to defeat them as we would any other serious international enemy that threatens to destroy us.</p>",
    "q3":"The TPP is a very complicated agreement. It will take months to determine all the potential ramifications included in it before it even comes up for a vote in Congress. I am troubled by what I know of it so far - it cedes too much authority over a wide variety of issues to international adjudication, and I would vote against it at this time.</p>",
    "q4":"The main promise of the Affordable Care ACt - affordability - has not been delivered. Infact, teh opposite has happened for millions of American. We need to repeal most of the Act. Retain the coverage for people with pre-existing conditions (as we had here in Maryland before the ACA), allow coverage for children up to age 25 on their parents' policy (as we had here in Maryland before ACA), and retain the elimination of annual caps on coverage (since modern cancer therapies and other therapies could easily exceed the limits that were allowed before the ACA). We must allow lower cost policies to be available - the costs of policies under ACA have risen too fast. Finally, we need to institute real cost-saving measures to bring down the cost of health care (not just health care insurance) by allowing patients to become more involved in health spending decisions through a variety of mechanisms that would lower cost while maintaining quality.</p>",
    "q5":"The Dodd-Frank law, though well-intentioned, has had the effect of destroying small and community banks throughout the First District. By insuring banks \"too big to fail\", the law has had the unintended effect of allowing only large banks to survive, and take risks that threaten a repeat of 2008.</p>",
    "q6":"Although President Obama was historic as the first African-American president, the President has failed on many fronts - race relations have worsened, health care costs rose, median family income fell, we feel less safe in our homes and in our country, and rancor between the our political parties has increased, not decreased. Our federal debt is now more than $55,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Unfortunately, this is the Obama legacy.</p>",
    "q7":"I don not support an increase in the minimum wage. With teenage unemployment, especially among minorities, at near record highs, now is not the time to destroy entry level jobs with an increase in the minimum wage, especially for young workers. Likewise, the federal government should not be increasing regulations on our employers and job-creators by requiring paid sick time or paid family leave.</p>",
    "q8":"Congress must protect the individual right to keep and bear arms guaranteed in the Second Amendment. We should, however, modernize and reform our mental health delivery system to treat those individuals who have serious mental health issues and might resort to violence, including gun violence.</p>",
    "q9":"This issue should be handled at both the state and the federal level. The Congressional district lines in Maryland are the laughing-stock of the entire country. I support Governor Hogan's efforts to reform our re-districting system, and would support amending the U.S. Constitution to the same end.</p>",
    "q10":"As the son of immigrants who has benefited from all this country offered my parents, my brothers, and my children, I am running to help restore America's greatness.</p>"

    "q1":"We need to engage Iran and bring them back into the world and this agreement starts that and does help prevent nuclear proliferation.</p>",
    "q2":"We need to cut off its source of funding. Bring together a coalition of allies in the middle east. The instability in the middle east has to be stemmed. The USA needs to maintain a active role in the middle east however we do not have to intervene militaryUpgrade our visa program and tracking of people that go to the middle east. Russia and China should also be brought into the coalition of nations to battle isis.America needs to provide military aid and intelligence to the allies. We should help train and equip troops for our allies. isis is not a religion we are not at war with Islam. We need to build relationships and have respect for are allies. have respect for Islam . Also bring in the kerds and help them build a state. There needs to be a realignment of the borders in the middle east. .</p>",
    "q3":"No I do not. We cannot have free and fair trade with nations that can enslave its people , have little to no environmental laws and low standards. America should help raise the standard of living and freedom and promote democracy around the world. We should not just have a race to the bottom to get the most for the least and help drive all new wealth to the 1 percent. Free Trade deals have not be very good for the vast majority of americans or for our national defense. Also for the most part they have help the few and powerful exploit people from around the world. Free trade has not provided the people of china with more freedom . They have a little more money and a great deal of pollution and exploration. The communist elites have grown rich and there military has gained more power and has become more a threat to america with there increased wealth.</p>",
    "q4":"Open up the insurance market beyond state lines. Have more competition. Streamline the administration process. Do more to control drug cost and bring in more medical professionals.</p>",
    "q5":"Yes they where appropriate , we need more regulation of the market. We need to bring on the level of regulation that we had before the deregulation boom of the 80's and 90's.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama started the reform of health care. There has been a need to reform health care for 40 years and every year the need grew. He created the first positive step and now I see us moving for more protection and change. I feel the start of health care reform was the presidents greatest accomplishment.</p>",
    "q7":"If the minimum wage would have keep up with inflation it would be around $17 per hour. In 1972 it was $1.40. The tunnel toll was .25cents . Now its $4. The higher wage would not cost jobs and would stimulate the economy. With so many working people making the minimum and working in poverty. America spends money on food stamps and social programs. People should not work full time and remain in poverty. With the higher wage there will be less need for government programs. Yes paid sick time helps everyone. It keeps america health. Family leave also is important and it is a humane thing. It helps build a more secure work life.</p>",
    "q8":"More money for mental health and community outreach. There should be a concerted effort to place violent people in jail. Less effaces on non-violent drug offenders.More support to local law enforcement.</p>",
    "q9":"For real democracy we need a non-partisan federal commission to redraw and redo the federal congressional districts.</p>",

    "q1":"I supported this bipartisan agreement after intense study and negotiation with the White House. While the JCPOA remains imperfect, it is the best opportunity we have to reduce Iran's nuclear threat and its ability to export terrorism. It removes the greatest weapon from one of our most dangerous adversaries and helps protect our ally, Israel.</p><p>Without the JCPOA, time was not on our side. Iran was only two to three months away from having enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon. Pushing Iran back to negotiations was not only unfeasible, but dangerous. The U.S. no longer had the support of our allies to keep international sanctions in place. The JCPOA stopped Iran's progress dead in its tracks, and crippled its ability to build a nuclear weapon for at least 10 years.</p><p>In addition to international sanctions, the United States can still enforce domestic sanctions on Iran's non-nuclear activities and can still create new sanctions on the Iranian regime if needed. For example, I am cosponsoring legislation to enforce new sanctions against Iran because they violated U.N. Security Council resolutions pertaining to ballistic missile testing.</p><p>I secured explicit assurance from the White House that the military option will be considered if Iran advances toward a nuclear weapon at any point during the deal's lifetime. As an Appropriator, I also helped secured a commitment for greater military aid to Israel, including a robust Foreign Military Financing package, continued access to the U.S. arsenal and increased missile defense funding.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is a unique threat to our country because these terrorists are not only barbaric, they are very well-organized and very well-funded. Battling ISIS in Syria has been very different than dealing with them in Iraq because Syria has sophisticated air defense systems. As Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I received regular briefings on the threat and traveled to Syria. Those briefings strengthened my resolve to destroy ISIS.</p><p>We must continue our successful air strikes in coordination with our allies. We must continue using U.S. Special Operations to take the fight to ISIS. But we cannot be the sheriff of the world; we must engage other countries in dealing with ISIS. I recently traveled to Russia and met with high-ranking officials to ensure that we fight our common threat: ISIS. We also need our Arab allies to take a larger role and commit significant troops to defeat these terrorists.</p><p>At home, we need American Muslim leaders to stand up and denounce ISIS. We must also counter ISIS' recruiting efforts on social media and bring jihadists in our country to justice.</p><p>In the long-term, we need to join with the international community in pursing cease-fires and a political resolution to the Syrian civil war.</p>",
    "q3":"I have opposed the most recent free trade agreements considered by Congress because I believe they hurt the U.S. labor market and provide few benefits to the businesses in my district. We must recognize that we live in a global economy, but our first priority must be American jobs. I therefore cannot support the TPP agreement at this time.</p><p>In addition, I oppose the so-called \"Fast Track\" process, which would allow the administration to negotiate trade deals without Congressional oversight. Fast Track ignores our Constitutional system of checks and balances, enabling Congress to only vote \"yes\" or \"no\" on trade deals without the ability to amend or improve them.</p>",
    "q4":"During ACA negotiations, I lobbied my colleagues to include an exemption for small businesses who might not have the means to provide healthcare benefits to employees. Thanks in part to my efforts, the final bill included an exemption for companies that employ 25 or fewer workers. I would have like to see this threshold increased to 50 employees to exempt even more small businesses and provide greater flexibility. </p><p>The ACA got the camel's nose in the tent and has produced positive results for many – seniors especially. The bill has helped reduce the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and guaranteed they can be insured even if they have pre-existing conditions, for example. </P><p>This is why I would like to see the bill improved rather than repealed. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has voted more than 60 times to repeal the bill, and not once to improve it.</p>",
    "q5":"Yes, they were appropriate and, yes, more needs to be done. Wall Street collapsed because of irresponsible decisions that devastated everyday Americans. People lost their jobs, their homes and their retirement savings. Yet, while middle class wages stagnate, executive compensation and bonuses continue to soar to unprecedented levels. Someone needs to be held accountable and we need to guarantee to my constituents – and my country – that this never happens again. We need to remove excessive risk-taking and restore accountability in the financial system.</p>",
    "q6":"The President's greatest success – and what will be his legacy – is engaging young people and making politics more accessible to Americans who previously felt left out. More than 12 million young Americans elected Barack Obama in a history-defying voter turn-out. He is the first president to effectively use social media to communicate with the electorate and directly promoted the increased use of social media among government agencies. He produces Vine videos, is on Pinterest and live-streamed this year's State of the Union. He has forever changed the way the President speaks to America.</p><p>One of the President's biggest failure has been his inability, or perhaps unwillingness, to work with Congress to get things accomplished. The President relied heavily on Democratic leadership to lobby lawmakers on his policy positions rather than building relationships and working directly with Members of Congress on common sense compromises. As a result, the partisan bickering that he pledged to end has only worsened.</p><p>I would be remiss if I did not mention Syria as one of the President's greatest failures. President Obama drew a \"red line\" on chemical weapons in Syria. Yet, when Assad used sarin gas on his own people, we did not act. This irreparably damaged our credibility with our allies and set us up for the situation we find ourselves in today.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, in fact, I am cosponsoring legislation to gradually raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $12 by 2020. It would also index the minimum wage to keep pace with the country's rising median wage. In Maryland, more than 600,000 workers – including 93,000 working mothers – stand to benefit from this bill.</p><p>No one who works full time should live in poverty. Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker earns about $15,000 a year - or 19 percent below the poverty line for a family of three. Since the minimum wage reached $7.25 six years ago in 2009, the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation or the growth in the median wage, resulting in low-wage workers continuing to fall behind. In fact, the real value of today's minimum wage is less than it was in 1956.</p><p>Economists agree that, if done right, raising the federal minimum wage could be good for business. Today, the top 1 percent of the population owns 35 percent of the country's wealth. If we evened out this disparity, the paychecks of the lower-wage earners would get pumped right back into the economy and other local businesses. Consumer demand goes up, there is greater productivity and less turnover, offsetting the higher labor costs associated with raising the minimum wage for employers.</p><p>I support required paid sick leave among government agencies and contractors and think we should explore tax incentives that would enable all small businesses to provide it as well.</p>",
    "q8":"I strongly believe in the Second Amendment, but we also have a Constitutional responsibility to protect American citizens from harm. I support efforts to ban true assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which have been the weapons of choice for mass shooters because their sole purpose is to inflict as much damage as possible as quickly as possible. When assault weapons or high-capacity magazines have been used in a shooting, the number of casualties has increased 63 percent. So while a ban may not stop these attacks, it will help drastically reduce the bloodshed.</p><p>I also support requiring background checks for all gun sales, including those purchased online and at gun shows and addressing the sale of firearms to the mentally ill.</p>",
    "q9":"Redistricting should be handled at the national level because a state-by-state approach could be used to disadvantage one party over the other. I believe a set of national, nonpartisan rules would result in moderate districts that are more representative of the American people, with pragmatic lawmakers that will work toward what's best for the country rather than what's best for their party.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office for the same reason I got into politics in the first place: to help people. My office has helped hundreds of families avoid foreclosure. We've helped veterans access the benefits they have earned. We've helped seniors navigate the Social Security and Medicare systems. I want to continue providing the best level of constituent service available in the country to the citizens of the Second District.</p><p>I am also asking voters to allow me to continue creating jobs for the middle class and bringing federal funds back to the district. As a Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am in a position to ensure Maryland's Second District gets its share of the federal pie. This role will become even more critical as I become the last Democrat in the Maryland delegation on the committee.</p><p>I also believe Congress needs more moderate voices, rather than ideologues and obstructionists who will put their party over their country. I have built strong relationships with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and I continue to believe that we can learn from one another and work together to make our country great again. Compromise is hard work – it means rolling up your sleeves, listening to one another and negotiating in good faith. This is something I have practiced in my personal life, in business and in politics.</p>"

    "q1":"The Vienna Accord was not the best deal but far better than military action. There was an apocalyptic push from hawkish Republicans and many Democrats towards military confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program. Lets not wait until the agreement expires, the goal now should be a peaceful and secure Middle East free from all nuclear weapons.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS will be defeated by a United front not a divided one. Russia and its allies are pursuing a strategy to keep Assad in power while the United States and its allies are pursuing a strategy to remove Assad from power. The United States should vigorously pursue the Syria peace agreement with Russia and its allies without preconditions; then unite with Russia and its allies to defeat ISIS. ISIS will cease to exist with a United world against it.</p>",
    "q3":"Yes, with the provision that companies may not move their base. This is to incentivize trade and create jobs. Provisions should be should be in place for participants to ensure the continued growth of the American workforce. However, if the provisions are not added, we need to realize that treaties that are beneficial to us as consumers may be detrimental to us as workers.</p>",
    "q4":"The one thing I would do to improve the Affordable Care Act is to increase the ability of people to choose or continue with their doctors. Many doctors have stopped accepting Medicaid patients due to low payments for services. I would push to provide subsidies for the poor and working poor to be able to afford private insurance. My wife delivered a \"still born\" baby boy in 2014. The doctor that cared for her during/after the pregnancy and knew her history stopped accepting her insurance. When she became pregnant in 2015 she was able to change to the insurance her doctor now accepted. With the doctors knowledge of my wife's history he was able to take preventive measures and thus my wife was able to deliver a healthy baby boy.</p>",
    "q5":"While we the people were applauding the increase in Wall Street regulation, the magicians (politicians) pulled another rabbit out of their hats. With Congress eliminating the Lincoln Amendment from the Dodd Frank financial regulation law means American banks are once again free to use taxpayer money to back-stop their speculative derivative trading.</P><P>Banks have began profiting so much from derivative trading that they have scaled back from lending which the American people need to make major purchases, start/expand their business and in turn stimulate the economy. The Lincoln Amendment should be added back to the Dodd Frank financial regulation law and more regulation is needed to refocus banks more on lending and not speculating which would lead us back to another financial crisis.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's legacy will be characterized by his fight for the cause and rights of minority groups' but there will be no greater legacy left from the presidency of Barack Obama than the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has given access to healthcare to millions of Americans. The Iran Nuclear Agreement and his work on climate change are also great accomplishments.</p><p>President Obama's greatest failure was his inability to reduce wars around the world which was a stated goal. The world is on fire and if effective diplomacy is not utilized we may be on the brink of another major war.</p>",
    "q7":"I support an increase of the minimum wage to $15 by 2020. The current minimum wage is outdated and too low for this day and time. The United States is the only industrialized Nations without paid sick time or family leave; this workplace policy is out of synch with the changing realties of modern families, and with changing roles of men and woman both at home and work.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe that people without being provoked would not resort to gun violence. Congress should put greater emphasis on identifying and treating the mentally ill before they become a danger to the public. Congress should also enact stricter laws against gun trafficking especially focusing on \"straw purchasers\" who have continuously transferred guns to prohibited owners. Finally, Congress should expand background checks for gun purchasers. Currently, the private sales \"loophole\" exempts an estimated 45 percent of gun purchasers from background checks, which are meant to ensure criminals and the mentally ill do not acquire guns.</p>",
    "q9":"The process by which congressional district lines are drawn have been overdue for reform because of the conflict of interest involved. Legislators have the ability to draw their own district boundaries, dividing neighborhoods or groups of people in ways that benefit their own electoral needs. I support the creation of Nonpartisan Independent Redistricting Commissions to replace the current Congressional redistricting process. The majority of the commission should be composed of members not affiliated with either major political party.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for Congress in the 3rd District to represent the People and help restore a government of, by and for the people. Together we can remove the career politicians who represent billionaires that continue to manipulate them. These same career politicians have begun screaming for change in campaign finance only to win an election. There is also a need to set term limits on Congress to infuse new ideas and change the status quo which will move our country forward. The American people have been complaining for years about the \"do nothing Congress\", now is the time for action to remove the political establishment.</p>"

    "q1":"I will support a second look at Iranian sanctions and other options for containing Iranian support of terrorism, as well as the expansion of their nuclear program. In the rush to sign an agreement, sanctions were lifted from known supporters of terrorism who had nothing to do with the nuclear program. Some of these same actors were responsible for funding and equipping forces in Iraq that killed or maimed hundreds of Americans. Iran has subsequently expanded its influence in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. I will listen to the concerns of the voters in the 3rd District and support measures to make Iranian expansionism more difficult. Due in part to the excesses of this agreement, America has lost the initiative in the Middle East. President Obama agreed to the Iran Nuclear Deal that the majority of Americans opposed by a 2-to-1 margin. I will support policies that are supported by the majority of Americans, that clarify our positions for those that support and oppose us, and provide rules of engagement that will accomplish our goals. I support a strong military presence in the region to counter the narrative that America is abandoning our allies in the Middle East.</p>",
    "q2":"As a Navy/Marine Corps veteran who has deployed twice to Iraq as the Commander of a Shock Trauma Platoon, I have experienced the human cost of war. A strong defense comes from a well-equipped and well-maintained military with a reasonable and firm foreign policy that puts the security of the homeland as its first priority. Generally while addressing international disputes with ISIS, diplomatic and economic measures should be exhausted first. However, I am resolute in my belief that if armed conflict is necessary for the security of American liberty and our way of life then the armed forces, and those of our allies should have the resources, direction, and rules of engagement required to bring the fight to the enemy and win as swiftly as possible – in their homeland, and not in ours.</p>",
    "q3":"I support policies that balance the protection of US industries with the global free trade that is the backbone of our economy. I recognize that there are times that government must intervene with other nations who have tilted the playing field to give an advantage to their home industries. Government intervention must be with a light hand, not picking industries that have government connections. We must work hard to eliminate \"crony capitalism.\"</p><p>In general, I support free trade that encourages a level playing field internationally and allows foreign markets access to US products and US consumers access to foreign products. However, when governments get involved in the nation's industry, they distort the normals rules of free trade. That's when our government must intervene on behalf of our industries. It is in our interest to open Pacific markets to US products in preference to the Chinese products. I am not for trade rules that would adversely affect specific industries native to the 3rd District of Maryland. This is when it is important to listen to the voters in the District. As their representative, I will hear their concerns before concluding a position based solely on the party position.</p>",
    "q4":"As a doctor myself, I know improving the Affordable Care Act is one of the cornerstones of regulatory relief, which will empower small business growth, decrease insurance costs, lower deductibles, all while maintaining universal coverage.</p><p></p><p>Many Americans are experiencing sharp increases in both health insurance premiums and deductibles – to the point that many have expensive insurance that covers very little of their actual health care costs. It has been reported that 60% of households do not have the cash on hand to cover their deductibles should they become ill. I would support policies that opened the sale of health insurance market across state lines. This would enlarge risk pools and lower costs. Further, I would support replacing the penalties and mandates of government-approved insurance with a refundable tax credit for the purchase of private insurance by all Americans. Lower income patients would no longer have the obstacle of having an insurance fewer and fewer doctors are taking. Older patients would be able to get policies that are tailored to their needs. And veterans would be given an alternative to the bureaucracies of the VA system. And to maintain universal coverage, I would support insurance subsidies for patients with high-risk, high-cost conditions. Real liability reform, along with a transition to paying for value will have the effect of lowering costs by putting the power and responsibility in the hands of those most closely affected, the patient and their doctor.</p>",
    "q5":"As a businessman myself, I know the heart of the American economic engine is small businesses, particularly new business start-ups. It's true that the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer, but this is due in part to the lack of new business startups that are one of the main drivers of employment. It is paradoxical that too often, the federal government's well-meaning but clumsy regulations that are intended to rein in the excesses of big businesses end up placing unsustainable burdens on small business. Dodd-Frank is a good example. In an effort to punish the excesses of big banks, a regulatory scheme was put in placed that is actually driving out small community banks and credit unions constrained by regulations that actually favor big banks. This, in turn, makes it harder for small businesses and startups to obtain credit from local lenders. The government needs to reform and streamline regulations and the tax code so that the innovative, entrepreneurial potential of the American people can flourish. I believe the corporate tax rate must be reduced if America is to remain the world's largest, most vibrant economy.</p>",
    "q6":"There can be no doubt that the greatest accomplishment of Barack Obama was the destruction of the glass ceiling for African Americans. History will record that these eight years stand as a reminder that the most powerful seat in the land can be occupied peacefully by any man of character and talent. However, this was also his greatest failure. He had the potential to become the American Nelson Mandela. A historic figure who would heal the centuries of the racial divide, showing the entire world that Americans are finally starting to realize the dream of Martin Luther King and the nation's founders that we are all truly equal. Unfortunately, I feel he was not up to the task. It appeared that he neither understood the obstacles or championed the successes encountered by his fellow Americans of both races. He will leave us more divided and less understood than we have been in a long time.</p>",
    "q7":"I support a free market that allows room for the least skilled workers to enter the market, learn the basics of work and responsibility, and move upward into higher skilled and higher paying positions. Government intervention in this natural process is, again, well-intended, but fraught with unintended consequences. High minimum wages feel fair, but they create a barrier to the entry of young and low-skilled worker just entering the market. Government intervention into the negotiations between labor and management hem in the options of both sides. Required sick time and family leave mandate lower wages and hurt those who don't avail themselves of the benefits. I support freedom of negotiation between labor and management that will reward the best of both with a steady and increased stream of high paying jobs with upward mobility.</p>",
    "q8":"I would support the actions of family and medical providers to remove the access to all means of violence, of those deemed to be a potential danger to themselves and others. However, I am a firm supporter of the 2nd Amendment, a gun owner, and two-time Iraq War Veteran. Just as the President and members of Congress are afforded the right to protection by those armed with a variety of weapons, the average American should likewise be afforded the same.</p>",
    "q9":"As residents of the most gerrymandered, the most contorted and scattered district in the nation, Maryland's Third District, we feel more alienated from our government today than perhaps any other time in our history. This practice of carving up of the electorate so that certain politicians can choose the voters who favor them and disadvantage those who don't is an embarrassment for Maryland and counter to the principles on which America was built. The Constitution places the responsibility for drawing lines for fair representation squarely on the shoulders of state legislators. Further, the Supreme Court has upheld cases that supported nonpartisan state redistricting commissions. As such, I fully support Governor Hogan's Redistricting Commission, and I will fight to let Maryland's Congressional districts represent the people living there — not the political will of party bosses.</p>",
    "q10":"When I volunteered to go to Iraq with the Marines at the tender age of 50, I was asked a similar line of questions. Why? Especially why now? The answers are surprisingly similar. First, I have a deep love of my country and a desire to serve. And second, I had a critical wartime skill, over 20 years of experience in emergency medicine/trauma. Today I am seeing, as many Marylanders have, that we desperately need legislators who have real world, outside the Washington bubble, life skills. Governor Larry Hogan set the precedent for my campaign. He, too, was not a politician, but rather a successful citizen businessman. Timing is everything, and 2016 is going to be a pivotal year, particularly as we deal with problems of national security, rebuilding the economy, especially small business, and finding sustainable solutions in healthcare. The people of Maryland are looking for real, practical answers from people with real, practical experiences. I've had successful careers in the military, medicine, and business. I am not looking for another career in politics. But I know, now more than ever, time is crucial and the risk to our nation is significant. I look at my grandchildren and realize that if I want them to be safe and to have the opportunities that I had, I need to step up and make sure that I do what I can to make that happen.</p>"

    "q1":"I supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) because I believe it will be effective in pulling Iran back from the threshold of becoming a nuclear weapon state and in keeping Iran away from that threshold for at least ten to twelve years. Thereafter, the detection regime that will remain in place, along with other U.S. and allied intelligence capabilities, should allow the United States to discover any attempt by Iran to breakout to a nuclear weapon and to make that discovery in time to thwart such an attempt. By contrast, walking away from the Agreement could leave the United States less informed regarding Iran's ambitions and less capable of mounting an effective response.My decision to support the JCPOA relies heavily on the fact that nothing in the Agreement in any way constrains the United States on Day 1 and in perpetuity from taking a full range of actions against Iran – economic, diplomatic and military – if it believes Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon. At root, the Agreement is a test – a test of Iran's readiness to pursue a different path. If Iran fails that test at any point along the way, I believe the United States will be well-equipped to act, and in taking whatever steps are necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, will have the strong support of its international partners.</p>",
    "q2":"I believe the threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is real and that the United States and the international community have a deep stake in addressing it. I recognize that humanitarian and international security issues necessitate efforts to combat this terrorist group's advance and ultimately to degrade and destroy it. That's why I support a strategy that would build a broad and diverse coalition of international partners to protect the US and its allies and meet the ISIL threat. While the US military can be used to stem the tide of violence, it is up to Iraqis and their Arab partners to create and ensure a long-term strategy for a safe and secure region.</p>",
    "q3":"Our trade policies have long assumed that \"free trade\" is the same as \"fair trade.\" I opposed Fast Track Authority for the TPP because I had serious concerns about both the process by which the agreement was developed as well as about its content. Negotiations for the TPP deal were conducted largely behind closed doors, with multinational corporations and other global conglomerates being disproportionately represented at the negotiating table. In addition, many portions of the proposed agreement were only shared on a classified and selective basis. All trade agreements – particularly ones of this size and scope – should be vetted with as much transparency as possible to ensure that the American public's interests are being protected. Finally, I was concerned that protections and enforcement mechanisms necessary to preserve workplace safety, protect the environment and promote human rights were not as robust as they could be. I worry that despite optimistic predictions about how the deal will lead to greater exports for American businesses, the actual effect will be to make overseas manufacturers the winners and unleash a flood of foreign goods into our economy, resulting in the loss of American jobs. I believe we must reset our nation's trade policies to ensure that fairness and American values guide U.S. trade agreements so that we can level the playing field for American businesses. I place a very high priority on preserving high-wage jobs, and on increasing the competitiveness of our companies domestically and abroad.</p>",
    "q4":"I support the Affordable Care Act because I believe it's a crucial step in our effort to reduce the cost of health care for families and small businesses, as well as to provide access for those who currently do not have insurance. The ACA is already providing lower costs and better health coverage for millions of Americans, including individuals who have received free preventive services, such as check-ups and cancer screenings; seniors in the \"donut hole\" who have saved billions of dollars on their prescription drugs; and small business owners who have used the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit to help them afford health insurance for employees. One of my top health care priorities is to address workforce shortages, particularly those for primary care physicians, who are a critical part of reorienting our healthcare system towards one that focuses on prevention and keeping people healthy, rather than one that only treats the sick. While we included several provisions in the ACA to alleviate some of these shortages more needs to be done. That's why I introduced H.R. 5498, the Primary Care Physician Reentry Act, which will help combat America's shortage of primary care physicians by encouraging mid-career and retired or retiring physicians to return to practice. This legislation would provide training and financial assistance to physicians returning to medical practice in exchange for their service at community health centers, Veterans Administration medical centers or school-based health centers.</p>",
    "q5":"It is no secret: past policies of lax regulation and oversight led to an \"anything goes\" culture within the financial services industry. That is why I supported the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform bill in 2010, which has begun to put an end to the risky practices that crashed the housing market and started the Great Recession. Still, more can be done and I will continue to fight in Congress for sensible reforms to our nation's financial market, such as improving access to sound retirement advice, strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and bringing strong oversight and regulation to the corners of the so-called \"shadow banking system.\"   </p>",
    "q6":"I believe that President Obama's legacy will be his efforts to guide our country through an economic crisis here at home as well as international turmoil with a steady, thoughtful hand. His greatest legislative accomplishments have been improving the health of the American people, through both the passage of the Affordable Care Act and his strong record on the environment. The ACA is improving access, affordability and quality of health care, resulting in the largest reduction of the uninsured in four decades. On the environment, the Obama Administration is working to address climate change by reducing air pollution and emissions, strengthening environmental protections and increasing our commitment to clean water. </p>",
    "q7":"I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 2150, the Raise the Wage Act. This bill would increase the minimum wage to $12 per hour. I support this legislation because I believe a fair wage is an important part of assisting many working parents who are struggling to support their families. Raising the minimum wage is a first step for many families and individuals to achieve self-sufficiency - to say nothing of the difficulty these families have in maintaining certain basic requirements such as health care, money for their children's education, or retirement savings. Paid leave – both sick leave and family leave – are important benefits that are vital to the morale of our workforce, the health of our economy, and the strength of our country. That is why I have cosponsored legislation that would set a national standard for paid sick days and I am also a strong supporter of paid family leave. </p>",
    "q8":"We have witnessed too many mass shootings and deaths as a result of gun violence and it is time to pass laws that protect innocent lives while safeguarding the rights of lawful gun owners. For too long, the NRA and gun manufacturers have deployed political contributions and high-powered lobbyists to defeat commonsense policies that could reduce gun violence in our communities – violence that kills more than thirty Americans every single day. The public overwhelmingly supports gun safety reforms. It is up to Congress to put public safety first, not the interests and profits of the gun lobby. That's why I have consistently supported gun control legislation that would close additional loopholes in our background check system, including the so-called gun show loophole; we should limit the availability of high-capacity magazines; and we must prevent high-powered, military-grade firearms from getting into the hands of those who wish us harm – including criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and individuals listed on the terrorist watch list. I have cosponsored multiple bills that would accomplish some of these goals, including the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 1217), which would ensure that all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act (H.R. 2380), and the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act (H.R. 752) which would prohibit the transfer or possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices. </p>",
    "q9":"I support creating national, independent and objective standards for drawing congressional districts. That's why I have worked with my colleagues in Congress to develop and introduce the Redistricting Reform Act of 2015, a comprehensive proposal that would establish independent redistricting commissions in every state.</p>",
    "q10":"I am proud to have made constituent service my number one priority. Traveling home to my district every evening allows me to do my job much better because I am in daily contact with the people I serve in Congress. I believe that being a good listener helps to guide my legislative efforts in Washington and has made me a better Congressman. That is the kind of representation I hope to continue to provide to the people of the Third District. One of my top legislative priorities in Congress is to end the reign of big money in our political system that has corroded our institutions of democracy. It's time to put government back in the hands of the public. That means promoting citizen-owned, grassroots funded, people driven campaigns. In an effort to fight back, I have introduced the Government Bythe People Act (H.R. 20). This legislation empowers grassroots supporters, includes a tax credit for campaign contributions and extra support to help candidates be heard when they are up against Super PACs and special interests. If enacted, this reform proposal would return our democracy to the people by amplifying the voices of everyday Americans.</p>"

    "q1":"Preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon must be among our most important foreign policy priorities. While vigilant diplomatic efforts must be asserted to prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, it is also vital that we keep all options on the table, including military force, when dealing with the Iranian state to ensure that the Iranian leadership understands the resolve of the international community on this issue. As a member of Congress, I would ensure that all agreements with Iran are closely monitored to ensure compliance. While I commend President Obama for negotiating an agreement with the international community to avert an immediate conflict with Iran, the recent negotiated Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action leaves many troubling issues—including a less than robust inspection and verification program, the immediate rather than gradual lifting of sanctions, and the unacceptably short, 15 year limitations period with verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program. Compliance with the international agreement will necessarily require close Congressional oversight.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is perhaps the fastest growing threat to our national security. It operates not only in Iraq and Syria, but consists of an international terrorist network across the Middle East and beyond, as well as an ideological movement of radical jihadism. The United States must target and defeat the entirety of ISIS. I concur with Secretary Clinton that America must lead in the fight against ISIS and \"Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS but to defeat and destroy ISIS.\" Our strategy should be to defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East. This involves an air campaign comprising our regional allies, with a no-fly zone over Syria, and with intelligence assets on the ground and local (not US) ground forces trained by US special operations forces to take back ISIS held territory. Our strategy must be to disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, and propaganda around the world. We can do this by sharing information with and insisting that our allies in the region step up their efforts. Through partnerships with local law enforcement and community leaders, especially with Muslim community leaders, we must identify causes and sources to prevent radicalization and recruitment in the US and abroad. Finally, our strategy must include hardening our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats. We have made significant progress since 9/11 and need to build on this progress and share our strategies with our allies.</p>",
    "q3":"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an extremely complex agreement that seeks to expand and support jobs here at home by lowering barriers to trade and increasing labor, environmental, consumer protection and intellectual property standards abroad. While I generally support free trade agreements, not all past deals have benefitted the U.S. economy and workers. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, our trade deficits with Mexico and Canada have escalated at rates higher than with other countries. Furthermore, it is well-documented that many manufacturing jobs have been lost to the offshoring of factories as a result of NAFTA. Regarding the TPP, I share the concerns expressed by many in industry and labor and among environmentalists. As a member of Congress, with access to the information necessary to make an informed decision, I would need to be satisfied that there are strong enough provisions to prevent Japan from engaging in currency manipulation, to ensure that corporate polluters do not get a free pass before international arbitration panels instead of U.S. Courts (where jurisdiction would be appropriate in our courts), to protect intellectual property rights of U.S. citizens and corporations, and to encourage greater investments in manufacturing jobs at home and not abroad. Congress has an important role in regulating trade among nations, and ensuring trade agreements support the U.S. economy and workers will be my guiding principle in deciding whether or not to support such agreements.</p>",
    "q4":"The Affordable Care Act has been one of the most significant accomplishments under President Obama's leadership and, as Lieutenant Governor, it was a privilege to work on the various implementation requirements of the ACA at the state level. While the launch of the health benefits exchange in Maryland was troubled with many problems at the outset, today hundreds of thousands of Marylanders have access to affordable, quality healthcare through the exchange. Looking forward, there are a number of provisions of the ACA that I believe need to be improved, for example expanding coverage to more categories of immigrants who do and will continue to access our health care system regardless of coverage. But one improvement that I would immediately seek to make as a member of Congress and should enjoy bi-partisan support in Congress is aligning the open enrollment period to buy coverage with the tax filing season when the incentives to purchase insurance or penalties for not doing so are squarely presented to taxpayers during tax season. This improvement to the functioning of the ACA would be similar to the existing Internal Revenue Service provisions that permit Individual Retirement Account contributions for the previous tax year to be made as late as the income tax filing deadline. As more and more Americans become more and more aware of the benefits and obligations under the ACA, we should continually seek to improve the functioning of the ACA.</p>",
    "q5":"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was designed to prevent the excessive risk-taking that led to the financial crisis in 2008. Key provisions in the law restrict banks from trading for their own profit and protect consumers and investors by creating and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to prevent mortgage companies and pay-day lenders from exploiting them. Although a key goal of the legislation was to prevent a rebuilding of a financial system that would permit banks to become so huge and intertwined that they would be \"too big to fail,\" the top banks today are bigger than they were in 2008. Many additional proposals have been made, primarily from Democrats, that I support. I support the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall to once again separate commercial banking from investment banking to better protect the public from risky investments. We need stronger regulations and regulators to enforce those provisions that allow for the breakup of big banks that make risky investments. I support a tax or \"risk fee\" on Wall Street speculation to discourage short-term risk taking and instead promote long-term investing. And I also support extending the provisions of Dodd-Frank to the so-called \"shadow banking\" sector—which includes certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank financial companies—that makes up a quarter of the global financial system. Finally, I would support reforms to campaign finance laws that seek to reduce or eliminate Wall Street's influence in politics.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's legacy should be characterized a success, particularly on domestic policy. From saving the American economy from a second Great Depression caused in large part by a broken financial regulatory system, to enacting the most sweeping reform of healthcare—the Affordable Care Act—since the 1960s creation of Medicare and Medicaid, our nation is better off today than when President Obama took office in January 2009. He made college more affordable for millions of students and their families by increasing investments in the Pell Grant Program and reforming the student loan program. America has significantly increased renewable energy generation and the global climate change agreement reached in December is a major step forward. We are a much more inclusive society, particularly for the LGBT community. However, there continue to be areas where this nation has not made significant progress, yet much of it is attributable to a Congress that is simply unwilling to work with the President. There was a narrow window of opportunity in President Obama's first term for meaningful immigration reform, yet today the only way forward is by executive orders that are tied up in the courts. There have been far too many tragedies compelling us to adopt common-sense gun regulations, but President Obama's efforts have fallen on deaf ears in Congress. Today we live in a world that is less stable than it was eight years ago, with the rise of ISIS and continued instability in the Middle East, and a more aggressive Russia.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I support an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15.00 per hour and I support paid sick leave or family leave in both the public and private sectors and across every industry. As a member of the House of Delegates and again as Lieutenant Governor, I supported raising the minimum wage in Maryland, passing the first and only living wage in the nation, and expanding the prevailing wage. I also supported increasing the earned income tax credit as part of Maryland's 2007 tax reform. More and more Americans have fallen below the poverty line and too many working families are struggling to get by. While I believe that creating higher paying jobs in manufacturing, technology, and energy, along with increasing educational opportunities and vocational training, are essential components to raising wages and addressing income inequality in our country, the lowest paid workers need immediate relief. As such, I support proposals that provide greater wages and benefits to workers. Given that profits for the largest corporations in America have risen steadily while real wages have been stagnant, I firmly believe that a tax on the largest corporations to help fund a paid sick or family leave program is reasonable.</p>",
    "q8":"Public safety is the most fundamental responsibility of government and reducing the toll of gun violence is part of the larger public safety effort. To achieve safer communities, we must focus on our most violent offenders and those who put our communities most at risk. But we must also increase our investments to support offenders and ex-offenders who are re-entering our communities. By educating returning offenders and assisting them with housing, job opportunities, and counseling, we can reduce recidivism, reduce crime and end the revolving door of the criminal justice system. In Maryland, we enacted meaningful gun regulations after the shootings in Newtown, CT. Those regulations included enhanced background checks, mandatory fingerprinting and firearm instruction, as well as limitations on the size of magazines and a ban on assault weapons. As Lieutenant Governor, I strongly advocated in Annapolis and at town hall meetings across the state for these common-sense gun regulations. We need to enact similar legislation at the federal level, as well as eliminate loopholes that exist for gun shows. Furthermore, more must be done to identify and treat individuals with mental illnesses who are likely to do violence to themselves and others. That requires greater investments in community-based mental health services. I led the effort to give judges greater authority to order domestic abusers to surrender their firearms when a protective order is issued, and as a member of Congress I intend to continue the effort to take guns off our streets.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe that much of the dysfunction in Washington is due to the manner in which congressional district lines are drawn. As a result of partisan gerrymandering, there is a tendency among many members of Congress not to seek compromise and consensus across party lines. The issue needs to be handled at both the federal and state level. At the state level, independent commissions should be established to draw district lines. Whether the process resembles the one recently upheld by the Supreme Court in Arizona or the proposal recently introduced by Governor Hogan, states should adopt either through legislation or voter referendum independent commissions that provide for an open, fair and transparent redistricting process. However, one state alone cannot fix the larger dysfunction in Washington caused by partisan gerrymandering. As a member of Congress, I would support federal legislation, and a constitutional amendment if necessary, either to expressly prohibit a political party from enhancing or preserving its political power through redistricting or to require every state to adopt independent redistricting commissions. Finally, as we seek to reform congressional redistricting to eliminate partisan gerrymandering, we must also renew and amend as necessary the Voting Rights Act to ban racial discrimination in voting practices by the federal government, as well as by state and local governments. While Maryland has a good record on this issue, there are far too many Americans who have been deprived full access to the ballot by the laws and practices in states and localities across this country.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for Congress because I believe Maryland is a great state with strong communities, but we must strengthen our communities in order to strengthen our families. That work begins by ensuring economic prosperity for more Marylanders. We'll build a stronger Middle Class by growing our economy, creating jobs, building the most competitive workforce and new ladders of opportunity, modernizing our infrastructure, developing Maryland's small business community, and supporting strong families that have access to affordable, quality healthcare, safe neighborhoods, and a clean environment. As a member of Congress, those will be my priorities.</p>"

    "q1":"The nuclear agreement expands Iran's nuclear breakout window from just a few weeks to a full year, giving the United States, Israel, and our European and Gulf allies a greater ability to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability. However, I believe the agreement came short of our goals. Specifically, the agreement gave too much to Iran and demanded too little in return. It only partially meets the objectives of the international community within a limited time period in return for fully and permanently lifting nuclear-related sanctions. That's why I've been a leader in calling for the most vigorous monitoring and enforcement regime possible - and for America to play a leading role in ensuring Iran abides by its commitments. In addition, I've made clear that we must take such action as is necessary to assure Iran's compliance with existing U.N. resolutions directed at Iran's non-nuclear activities, which undermine security and stability in the Middle East. </p>",
    "q2":"The United States needs to lead and apply the resources necessary to accomplish the mission of destroying ISIL. That includes strengthening efforts to reconstitute the Iraqi military so that it can retake Mosul; squeezing ISIL in its headquarters, Raqqah; and working with partners such as the Kurds to eliminate ISIL's territorial stranglehold in the region. I support efforts among Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE to deploy those nations' troops to Syria to fight ISIL, and I encourage the Obama Administration to increase its efforts to demolish ISIL's energy resources and work with Turkey to seal its borders from foreign fighters. </p><p>Ultimately, though, military efforts will not be successful without a political settlement, consensus on dealing with Assad, and robust response to the humanitarian catastrophe. Russia has made clear it is willing to stake blood and treasure on propping up the Assad regime, and I believe that the United States and our allies must continue working to convince Russia to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem. </p><p>ISIL's ideology is pernicious, evil, and dangerous and – as demonstrated by the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino – contagious among those who might become radicalized, even within our country. We need to ensure the intelligence community is fully coordinated with federal, state, and local law enforcement to prevent lone-wolf attacks. I also support counter-radicalization efforts to combat recruitment. ISIL presents a dual threat, both as a destabilizing force in the region and as a counterterrorism challenge globally.</p>",
    "q3":"I am continuing to review the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement while I listen to the views of my constituents, stakeholders and my colleagues. I believe each trade agreement should be evaluated on its merits.</p>",
    "q4":"The Affordable Care Act is working and millions of Americans are gaining access to affordable, quality health coverage each year. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act while ruling that one of its key provisions—the expansion of Medicaid—must be optional for states. Over 17 million previously uninsured Americans have gained coverage under the law and 31 states, led by both Democrats and Republicans, have expanded their Medicaid programs. Because of Medicaid expansion in Maryland, more than 600,000 Marylanders enrolled in Medicaid in 2015. </p><p>Unfortunately, 19 states have refused federal funding for Medicaid expansion, despite the demonstrated social and economic benefits. I would urge each of these states to expand their Medicaid programs to ensure access to preventive care and other needed medical services for our country's most vulnerable families. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, this would provide access to affordable health care coverage for nearly 3 million uninsured Americans in those states.</p>",
    "q5":"Yes. Wall Street is being held more accountable while consumers are being protected from misleading and abusive lending practices. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act safeguards Americans from the kind of reckless behavior that took place in our financial markets in the years leading up to the near-collapse of our financial system – and which led to the loss of millions of jobs and weakened our economy. </p><p>I will continue to work with my colleagues to oppose efforts to weaken the Dodd-Frank law while also strengthening the law to ensure that our financial markets are the safest in the world, that private sector growth continues, and that our middle class has access to the tools and opportunities they need to get ahead in today's new economy.</p>",
    "q6":"Under President Obama's leadership, his Administration has helped to restore our economy and provide Americans with access to opportunities to adapt to today's new economy. Our economy has seen seventy-one consecutive months of private sector job growth, with over 14 million private sector jobs created since the President took office. More jobs have been added over the past two years than in any two-year period since 1998-2000. In addition, the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008. </p><p>Also under President Obama, millions of Americans have gained access to affordable health coverage. Patients cannot legally be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition, be subjected to annual and lifetime coverage limits, or be charged a higher rate just for being a woman. In Maryland alone, more than 162,000 individuals enrolled in health coverage for 2016. According to Gallup, the uninsured rate in Maryland was down from 12.9 percent in 2013 to just 7 percent in mid-2015.</p><p>I am also proud that President Obama's first action was signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law to make it easier for women to fight against pay discrimination. The enactment of that law was a significant milestone in the march toward full equality by providing women with legal recourse if they had been paid less than their male counterparts in prior years. </p>",
    "q7":"I have cosponsored legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. The current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has not been raised for seven years. In 1968, the minimum wage was over $10.50 an hour in 2015 dollars. Americans overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage as do many businesses. A higher minimum wage will help more people not only stay afloat financially but also help them start to get ahead.</p><p>I also cosponsored the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act (FEPPLA), a bill which would provide six weeks of paid leave for federal employees for the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. More broadly, Congress should take action to protect workers in our economy from having to choose between losing their jobs or staying home to care for themselves or for a sick child. </p>",
    "q8":"Congress should close the loopholes in our laws that enable violent criminals and those on terror watch lists from being able to purchase dangerous firearms legally without a background check. Studies show that every day where background checks are used, the system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe strongly that the 114th Congress should adopt a law requiring all states to establish nonpartisan or bipartisan redistricting commissions, similar to those in Arizona and Iowa.</p>",
    "q10":"It is an honor to represent Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, and I am proud to work across the aisle to deliver results for my constituents. I have been successful in helping to create and save thousands of jobs in and around the Fifth District at federal facilities and military installations such as NASA Goddard, NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, and the FDA Center for Food Safety in College Park. I am also leading the Make It In America jobs plan in Congress to spur the creation of well-paying jobs in our country. I am dedicated to improving Maryland schools and keeping them among the best in the nation, as well as investing in our infrastructure and keeping our neighborhoods safe. I have served as a strong advocate for the over 62,000 federal employees in our district. I've also worked to protect our natural resources, including the Chesapeake Bay, and improve veterans' access to health care. I would like to continue this work on a bipartisan basis to deliver results and improve the quality of life for Fifth District families.</p>"

    "q1":"I vehemently oppose the Iran agreement. The Administration agreed to provide the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism with more than $100 billion, allowing Iran to further develop its ICBM program and to finance its efforts to support terrorist organizations. The inspection regime is woefully insufficient. What is particularly disturbing are the \"side agreements\" between the IAEA and Iran. Our Congress was not allowed access to those agreements – essentially putting the United States in a situation of agreeing to a contract that it cannot even read. The Administration has made the world more dangerous and has placed the United States and our key ally Israel at substantial risk.</p>",
    "q2":"First and foremost, the United States must repeal sequestration and bolster the defense budget so that the military has the resources it needs to confront and defeat the threat of ISIS. But we must also recognize that the threat of ISIS exists here in the homeland, as well. We must address immigration weaknesses and failures, secure our borders, and prohibit the influx of Syrian refugees until we can confirm they are refugees and not ISIS infiltrators.</p>",
    "q3":"Maryland lost 1,500 jobs after NAFTA. I am concerned that the TPP, as it stands now, presents a risk to Maryland workers and jobs because it would incentivize companies to move more jobs overseas. We must carefully scrutinize such agreements to ensure that its provisions benefit American workers and businesses, not penalize them.</p>",
    "q4":"While working to repeal Obamacare, there are provisions that could be remedied immediately. To help small businesses, I would propose raising the number of employees triggering the Obamacare mandate from 50 to 100. This would reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses and minimize the move toward a part-time job economy. I would also allow cross-state-border access to the healthcare insurance exchanges, creating competition that would likely result in considerably lower costs for insurance.</p>",
    "q5":"The Administration and a Democrat-controlled Congress went way too far in overregulating American businesses. Dodd-Frank imposed over 400 new rules and regulations, mandates that have stifled job creation. These rules have been particularly burdensome for small and medium-sized businesses that cannot afford in-house compliance and counsel. Further, this law enshrined \"too big to fail,\" thereby putting taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts. It is time to bring common-sense solutions back to Washington.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's legacy has been one of failure and disappointment. His single greatest failure is the Iran agreement, which has put the American people and our allies at substantial risk. I am not aware of any successes.</p>",
    "q7":"I do not support an increase in the federal minimum wage because such increases stifle job creation and will result in fewer jobs available. Before the federal government imposes additional requirements on paid sick time and family leave, it must consider the impact on small businesses. Small businesses need flexibility to find solutions that work for their particular situations and needs. Along with many other issues, the overarching theme of my approach is to minimize government mandates and regulations! This does not accomplish that goal.</p>",
    "q8":"Multiple federal gun laws already exist. Before enacting new laws, the Administration should enforce laws that are already on the books. It must be careful not to infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the American people. Having said that, I do believe that more must be done – at state, local, and community levels primarily – to ensure that individuals with mental health disorders receive the help they need. </p>",
    "q9":"I support Governor Hogan's efforts to reform the redistricting process to create more geographically sensible districts in Maryland. This should be a state issue. We do not need the Federal government imposing into the needs and priorities of Marylanders.</p>",
    "q10":"I am gravely concerned about our country's national security posture. We face the greatest threats in our nation's history, yet this Administration not only would reduce the U.S. military posture but also has taken steps that have resulted in severe degradation of our international standing. Instead of bolstering our national security to deal with terrorism, the Administration has focused on ill-conceived agreements with Iran and China, agreements that put Americans at even greater risk. As Congresswoman, I will fight to ensure the safety and security of the American people.</p>"

    "q1":"In many respects, I view the JCPOA as a poorly negotiated deal. While it has some strengths – eliminating Iran's current nuclear program, materially restricting Iran's enrichment capabilities for 15 years, cutting off Iran's various paths to a nuclear weapon across the same time period, and providing greater inspections access - it is too short in duration and is weak on access to conventional weapons and ICBMs. Considering our leverage, we should have negotiated a better deal. In analyzing the Iran deal, I explored whether voting to reject the deal could have led to something better. But after considering that we had 'showed our hand' and that all of our partners were committed to this deal and were set to lift their sanctions, I came to the conclusion that this was unlikely. Therefore I ultimately voted for the deal which I viewed to be the lesser of two bad options. Now we must make sure that 1) Iran doesn't cheat and that they are held accountable if they do 2) we combat Iran's efforts to support terrorism and 3) we make sure that we stand with Israel and our allies against Iranian aggression. In January, I introduced legislation to levy sanctions against Iran on entities that transfer ballistic missiles or advanced conventional weapons to or from Iran. My legislation would broaden the reach of current sanctions. I introduced this legislation to ensure that we hold Iran accountable for violations of ballistic missile and advanced conventional weapons bans.</p>",
    "q2":"I take ISIS at their word, that they are singularly focused on their heinous agenda and will do everything they can to kill and terrorize Americans and our values. We must do more to take the fight to ISIS, starting with debating a new authorization of military force in Congress that outlines clear parameters and provides the President with bipartisan authorization to definitively defeat ISIS forever. I support additional air strikes against ISIS supporting allied nations from the region taking the fight to ISIS, strengthening our efforts to starve their financial assets and making sure that our intelligence agencies have the tools and resources they need to fight and destroy ISIS.</p>",
    "q3":"I supported giving President Obama the authority to negotiate the TPP because I believe that he would negotiate a deal that is good for workers, good for the environment and good for our economy. The TPP was only recently finalized and I am still reviewing the details of the agreement, which is thousands of pages long, to make sure that it is good for Maryland. To be clear, in principle I support the TPP and believe that President Obama has negotiated the most worker friendly and environmentally friendly trade agreement in history. The bottom line is that we already operate in a global economy and moving forward I want the United States setting the agenda, not China.</p><p>In analyzing Maryland's economy and trade policy, I think about the importance of agriculture across the state, strengthening and expanding the Port of Baltimore, and continuing to grow our intellectual capital industries. In my view the TPP is going to open new markets to Maryland farmers, bring new economic activity to the Port, and create opportunities for our bio, IT, and cyber industries. And right now, both rural Maryland and Baltimore are two parts of our state that need more economic development. On balance, trade and foreign investment already materially helps Maryland's economy and if you care about Maryland's economy you have to care about trade. According to the Department of Commerce, last year 59,000 Maryland jobs were supported by over $12 billion in exports. </p>",
    "q4":"Overall the Affordable Care Act has been good for the country. Thanks to the ACA more people have coverage, people with preexisting conditions can actually get coverage, young people can stay on their parents' plan longer, women can't be charged more simply because they're women, and health care costs are finally growing less than the rate of inflation – something that has not happened for decades and something that is incredibly important to the deficits and debt of the United States. I think that the ACA can be improved by removing the penalties it places on high-quality employer-provided plans and repealing the Medical Device Tax.</p>",
    "q5":"Absolutely - increased regulation and consumer and investor protections were needed and appropriate. The 2008 financial crisis was one of the most damaging economic downturns of the last century and one that seriously hurt working families and the middle class. As a result of the financial crisis 19 of the 20 largest financial firms in the United States either failed or required government funds. If that's not the backdrop for reform, I don't know what is. Thousands of families lost their homes, we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs each month and the majority of the largest financial firms in the country were in danger of collapsing. It would have been unthinkable not to act. But our work isn't done. It's ridiculous that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is under daily attack from Congress and I have defended the CFPB on the Financial Services Committee. I have also authored housing finance reform legislation to save the 30-year mortgage and protect taxpayers from future bailouts. Finally, I have worked closely with President Obama on the new investor protections being led by the Department of Labor, which will prevent investors from getting bad advice due to a conflict of interest from their broker. This is a major problem that is especially hurting retirees and I was proud to stand with Senator Elizabeth Warren and the President when these new protections were announced last year.</p>",
    "q6":"Any analysis of President Obama's legacy has to include the fact that he was presented with one of the worst hands of any President, ever. The economy was reeling losing half a million jobs per month when he took office and we were still immersed in an ill-conceived war in Iraq, a war that ultimately cost Americans dearly in terms of lost lives and trillions of unpaid for expenditures. President Obama put the brakes on the financial crisis and led us out of the Great Recession. In fact, the United States has performed much better than any of our economic competitors. Second, he has led on climate change, which I view as a significant threat to our national security – something our military has confirmed by calling it a \"threat multiplier\" – and overall American economic prosperity. Third, the Affordable Care Act has given millions of Americans coverage they didn't have before and the President has led on LGBT rights. Finally, under his leadership we brought Osama bin Laden to justice. I still think we have real work to do to create good-paying jobs, address income inequality, and strengthen the middle class, starting with additional major infrastructure investments. I am disappointed that we did not use this sustained period of low interest rates to invest in infrastructure and rebuild our country and I have worked tirelessly to do that. Finally, I think the humanitarian crisis in Syria demanded more action from the United States.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I am a cosponsor of legislation to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour and was the first state wide or federal elected official to call for an increase in the minimum wage in Maryland. I also strongly support paid family leave and sick time. No one should suffer financial hardship just because they get sick. It is important to remember, however, that raising the minimum wage – while obviously important when you consider that it has lagged inflation – is only one small step we need to take to raise wages. A national infrastructure plan, which I have obtained material bi-partisan support for, would do even more.</p>",
    "q8":"Congress should stop listening to interest groups and start listening to the vast majority of Americans who support commonsense gun safety measures. Congress should start with implementing universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole and preventing those people who are on the no fly list from being able to buy a gun. <P></p>We also need to expand mental health availability so that those suffering from mental illness can access care before they commit crimes, provide more resources to law enforcement and first responders who are charged with protecting our citizens, improve coordination between federal, state and local agencies and taking steps to address the pervasive glorification and acceptance of violence in our country. </p>",
    "q9":"I support using independent commissions to draw district lines. This is a national problem that requires a national solution and I have introduced legislation that includes redistricting reform, creating open primaries and making Election Day a holiday. I am not opposed to efforts to do redistricting reform at a state level if it is truly a bipartisan effort.</p>",

    "q1":"The long-standing, non-partisan and publicly-declared foreign policy commitment of the United States is that we will do whatever is required to prevent Iran from possessing nuclear weapons. Although I would have preferred even more stringent and comprehensive limitations upon Iran's ability to construct and deploy a nuclear weapon, some of our best nuclear scientists concluded that, without approval and implementation of the JCPOA, the current \"breakout time\" for Iran's ability to produce an operational nuclear weapon was only months. I concluded that the JCPOA significantly enhanced our ability to change that deadly timetable, both immediately and in the longer term. Iran was required to reduce the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds, cease production of weapons-grade plutonium, halt construction of a heavy-water reactor, get rid of 98 percent of its existing enriched uranium, and halt enrichment of uranium above 3.67 percent purity. That resolution to the immediate threat posed by Iran's nuclear program were compelling, as were the longer-term security capabilities gained by the intrusive nature of the inspections provided by the JCPOA and our nation's unilateral ability to \"snap back\" the whole range of sanctions in the event of any future Iranian noncompliance.</p>",
    "q2":"Consistent with national security considerations, I can publicly confirm my support for this broader vision. We must and will defeat ISIS, but only by sharing the fight with a broad coalition of allies (more than 60 at this time) can we prevent the United States from being drawn into another long war. Our current strategy includes an expanding commitment to cut off ISIS from its finances, stop the flow of foreign fighters, counter ISIS propaganda, join in airstrikes against ISIS military targets, build the capacity of allied fighters on the ground, and provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who are being displaced and harmed.</p>",
    "q3":"No. Generally, I support free trade, but to achieve our national goals, free trade must also be fair and smart trade. Although we continue to review the proposed trade agreement, I am deeply concerned that the TPP would cost our nation jobs, would not adequately protect the environment, would not adequately ensure the safety of our imports, nor provide America's workers a more level playing field with respect to underpaid workers overseas.</p>",
    "q4":"I have long supported universal access to healthcare under a single-payer system based upon expansion of Medicare to all Americans at birth. Although I have strongly supported the Affordable Care Act as an important first step toward this goal, I was disappointed that we were unable to overcome opposition to a public option in the legislation.</p>",
    "q5":"There is little doubt that the financial crisis devastated the lives of most Americans – costing 9 million workers their jobs, driving 5 million families out of their homes, and wiping out more than $13 trillion in household wealth. I was proud to vote for the Dodd-Frank legislation, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is adding significant protections for American families. However, we must be vigilant and continue to fight against efforts to weaken and delay the legislation's protections, at the same time limiting the ability of federally-insured institutions to engage in risky practices.</p>",
    "q6":"I was honored to lead President Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns here in Maryland, and, on balance, I believe that history will evaluate his presidency as a great one. His leadership – often in the face of partisan political opposition — brought our nation back from the most devastating recession in our lifetime, saving millions of jobs, significantly expanded our access to healthcare, moderated our involvement in foreign military conflicts, moved us forward in protecting our environment, and, once again, gave us a President whom Americans can trust.</p>",
    "q7":"I have long supported an increase in the federal minimum wage to a level consistent with a living wage. I also support both paid sick time and family leave.</p>",
    "q8":"Gun violence has devastated the lives of tens of thousands of American families every year, including my own. Yet, conservative opposition has prevented us from taking the reasonable steps that would better protect us, including an expanded and more effective background check system and assuring that those with serious mental health issues do not have access to firearms. In the current and past sessions of Congress, I have been proud to be among those leading the fight to pass the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2015 [H.R. 3455], which would directly address concerns by law enforcement officials who testified that a dedicated federal firearms trafficking statute would help them combat the flow of thousands of firearms to violent criminals, international drug cartels, and a host of other dangerous people. Our legislation would make firearms trafficking a federal crime and impose stronger penalties for \"straw purchasers\" who buy guns for convicted felons and others who are prohibited from buying guns on their own.</p>",
    "q9":"Within the limitation of one-person, one-vote, both our federal Constitution and tradition have left the manner in which congressional district lines are drawn up to the states, not the Congress. Both the courts and Maryland's voters approved the last redistricting lines. Maryland's Legislature currently is considering whether to change the process in which our congressional districts are drawn; and I should and will defer to their judgment.</p>",
    "q10":"I am working for legislation that \"speaks to the center of people's lives.\" That \"center,\" as the late Senator Paul Wellstone once reminded us, includes a good education, health security, living-wage jobs, protecting our environment, and defending human rights. This is why, once again, I ask for my neighbors' continued support.</p>"

    "q1":"The Iran Deal is a bad deal and must be rescinded. Iran is a danger to Israel and its recent aggression in capturing our sailors and parading them in humiliation on TV was an outrage, as was its recent test of a missile, and were in violation of international law and the recent deal negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry. Iran cannot be trusted and must be vigilantly opposed in its attempt to obtain a nuclear bomb and we should work side by side with the State of Israel and lead our other allies to ensure that never happens.</p>",
    "q2":"We must have a vigorous defense of the homeland by pausing any refugees or persons from ISIS controlled or embattled areas from entering this country such as occurred in San Bernadino until the director of the FBI can certify that our vetting process of the refugees is secure and will not place our country in peril. Second, we should greatly increase air strikes against ISIS targets of every capacity including supplies, headquarters and government, and work together with our allies to ensure ISIS is destroyed.</p>",
    "q3":"I strongly support free trade and believe that free trade brings economic growth, jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. The need for a fair TPP is real. Yet, the TPP as it came down was a deal that in the end included two things that were an example of what Americans on both sides of the isle hate in our politics. First, a leaked immigration measure that would impact our immigration law without a vote in Congress. Second, the re-authorization of the Export-Import Bank, which is one of the worst examples of corporate welfare and misuse of our tax dollars. </p><p>Free trade deals are important and good whenever they protect American interests and do not unfairly cede authority to the World Trade Organization (WTO), or give us a bad deal in trading with other nations.</p>",
    "q4":"I would repeal the ACA. The average deductible for a plan with a payment most Americans would be stuck with is anywhere from $5000 to $11,000. That is not affordable. The tax penalty on those who don't purchase the insurance they cannot afford only makes it impossible for taxpaying citizens to make ends meet. I wold work to create tax credit incentives, not penalties, for purchasing insurance or for having private health care sharing or savings plans in place. This reduces the financial stress on the American taxpayer while encouraging real solutions to healthcare coverage.</p>",
    "q5":"We must repeal Dodd-Frank because it does not prevent future bank bailouts, but instead makes banks subject to micromanaging regulators. This has put thousands of small, local banks out of business. Reasonable regulations are needed for ensuring risk protection and to protect people from predatory lending, but Dodd-Frank is harming our economy and allowing little more than big government and big banks to take over more than one fifth of the US economy's GDP.</p>",
    "q6":"Although I appreciate President Obama's and the First Lady's fatherhood.gov initiative and his action in authorizing the Navy SEALs to take out Osama Bin Laden, I believe his legacy is one of bigger government and compromise with big corporations and banks, at the expense of the American taxpayer. His recent humble and reflective speech at the 2016 National Prayer Breakfast doesn't seem to reflect the apparent lawless nature of his issuance of unilateral executive orders which the federal courts have held in several occasions to be unconstitutional.</p>",
    "q7":"No, increasing the wage mandate will reduce jobs and that will harm the working folks that are seeking to get started in entry level positions. In Maryland, it is easier and more profitable to get paid full-time for welfare, rather than to work. Mandating welfare to work should instead be enhanced by economic mobility and eliminating the corporate income tax which drives businesses out of our state and out of our country.</p><p>As a parent just now expecting a baby with my wife, I understand the need for economic mobility and income stability. However, the path for that is not through more mandates on businesses which cannot function without workers who show up and perform their jobs. The federal government should not require pay for workers who cannot show up and do the job. This would be both unfair and disastrous to our economy. Instead, government should create tax credit incentives to businesses who voluntarily provide pay incentives to employees who perform well but need time off to have a baby or meet a family need because of sickness. Family leave is already the law and tasking employers with not only holding the job open but also giving paid salaries during that time without a tax incentive is nothing more than opening the door for societal disaster. The federal government is currently on a 1 year or more backlog of Social Security Disability cases because we are out of money. We cannot expect employers to carry a similar burden.</p>",
    "q8":"Today the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that Maryland's gun ban enacted under Governor O'Malley impacts our fundamental constitutional rights such that it triggers the Court's highest constitutional test requiring strict scrutiny. This is important because to reduce gun violence we must not infringe upon the right to stop gun violence. The only way to stop a criminal with a gun is a good person with a gun. Congress should ensure that every executive action taken by the President regarding the right to keep and bear arms, and every judicial action by the courts improperly burdening and impacting that right, are rescinded. I will always fight for our right to defend against gun violence with the right to keep and bear arms.</p>",
    "q9":"Yes it does, as the current lines are clearly gerrymandering at its worst. I support the state's right to fairly resolve this issue and I believe Governor Hogan's plan should be passed and implemented by the Maryland General Assembly. The federal courts are a last resort, but are at times necessary when gridlock at the state level advances injustice.</p>",
    "q10":"Like the upcoming Olympics this year, to shine forth a torch of hope for the people of the 8th Congressional District that the issues of security, freedom, financial and health stability and our individual rights as Americans will be fought for, protected and secured if I am elected as their Member of Congress.</p>"

    "q1":"To keep the peace and to nourish hope for stability and social progress in the Mideast, we must prevent the Iranian regime from becoming a nuclear power. I endorsed the Iran nuclear deal in the summer after several weeks of close study of the proposal. I became convinced that the Agreement successfully cut off a plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon and a uranium pathway while also imposing a muscular \"snapback\" sanctions provision. We need to vigorously enforce the terms of the agreement, including the comprehensive inspection regime, to ensure there is no cheating and that the \"snap-back\" sanctions remain a swift and effective deterrent to subterfuge and circumvention. Congress can also act to strengthen the deal in numerous ways, and it has every reason to do so.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is a terrorist death cult committed to savage attacks on civilians all over the world. Although the bitter folly of the Iraq War created the chaos and vacuum of power in which ISIS was born, we have no alternative right now to a policy of crushing and destroying ISIS. We must move aggressively to shrink the territory ISIS holds, strip it of control of the oilfields and disable the oil infrastructure, bomb the transportation modules, and above all use every domestic and international banking institutional resource we have to cut off the regional and global flow of money to ISIS. If we mobilize the military and financial resources of the U.S. and our allies, we should be able quickly to degrade the terror infrastructure that this group thrives on. However, in order to forestall the rise of the next terrorist theocratic movement with imperial and irredentist designs on a modern-day caliphate (remember how ISIS replaced Al Qaeda), we need to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law throughout the Arab world to counter Islamist propaganda. We also need to help unify this torn and ailing region with diplomacy and new patterns of social, political, cultural and economic development. Critical to the economic and political success of nations in the region is the protection of the equal rights of women and the promotion of educational and career opportunities for women.</p>",
    "q3":"Free trade is generally good for all the reasons that Adam Smith, David Ricardo and the 18th-century liberals posited: it reduces military and ideological conflict among nations, brings the people of the world into peaceful and constructive contact, and permits each nation to develop a \"comparative advantage\" or two while stimulating global commerce. However, in the current period, many of our free trade deals, beginning with NAFTA, have not been about simply removing tariffs and trade barriers—if they were, the agreements, would be 3 pages long—but rather facilitating access and advantage for large multinational corporations by dismantling domestic environmental, safety, health, labor, constitutional, and workplace regulations and even replacing domestic tribunals with corporate-dominated investor dispute arbitration mechanisms. These dynamics have not served the public interest in our country. Our trade deficit in 2015 was more than $500 billion and more than $365 billion alone with China, which means our trade imbalance with China grows $1 billion every single day. We have already outsourced more than three million service sector jobs and the TPP will undoubtedly further accelerate job flight. In the manufacturing sector, the U.S. lost nearly 700,000 jobs due to NAFTA, 2.7 million jobs as a result of the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and 70,000 jobs in the wake of the Korea agreement. I strongly favor free and fair trade but am deeply skeptical of deals like TPP which become captive to special-interest demands and lose sight of the overall common good.</p>",
    "q4":"While expansion of coverage to more than 18 million Americans has been an essential success with the ACA, health care costs remain way too high. Part of the problem is the cost of insurance bureaucracy and paperwork, but we have little room to maneuver around that until we get to a single-payer plan and that will take some years to get there. More immediately, we need to press forward with Medicare's payment reform experiments, such as the Accountable Care Organization, which is paid more when patients are actually healed and cured rather than simply seen and processed. The shift to outcome-based payment is historic but requires systematic research and analysis. I am advocating increased funding of biomedical sciences, including key units at the National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Health Research and Quality at HHS, in order to better study, understand and then improve the quality and effectiveness of health care actually being delivered under the ACA.</p>",
    "q5":"The mortgage meltdown crisis of 2008 cost Americans millions of jobs and homes and trillions of dollars in home equity, retirement and pension fund savings. The recklessness and misconduct on Wall Street inflicted terrible burdens on the American people, and were especially punishing to poor communities. This crisis hit Maryland hard. President Obama initiated a series of strong and overdue reforms of the financial sector, and the Dodd-Frank legislation was essential. But the reforms remain incomplete and we need to continue aggressive action to regulate reckless risk-taking and structural conflicts of interest in the financial sector. Specifically, financial regulators have not yet completed essential rulemaking processes to impose limits on incentive compensation for financial services executives. These reforms are necessary to limit excessively predatory risk-taking behavior and rein in some of the most destabilizing tendencies on Wall Street. They are also necessary to dampen some of the outrageous economic and political inequalities that now define the Citizens United age. Similarly, reforms regarding derivatives have stalled and compel our serious attention. We should also strengthen whistleblower statutes so that individuals can report cases of misconduct before they become a full-blown crisis. Fundamentally, we need regulators who will work for the American people, not for private interests.</p>",
    "q6":"I have always strongly supported President Obama and was proud to have chaired his 2008 presidential campaign in Montgomery County. We graduated from high school and college the same year, and I preceded him by three years as an Editor of the Harvard Law Review. I think he will be seen as a president who began to rescue us from the economic and foreign policy calamities of the George W. Bush administration and restored momentum to the progress of popular political and economic democracy. His administration (which my wife Sarah serves in, as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Department) brought us out of recession; presided over major jobs growth; passed the Affordable Care Act, which not only brought 18 million new Americans under health insurance coverage but guaranteed coverage to people with preexisting conditions and to young people up to 25 years old who could stay on their family plans; named (at least) two great Supreme Court Justices in Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan; reestablished ties with Cuba; and revived American diplomacy and international leadership while disengaging from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Major failures, mostly due to partisan obstructionism, include the lack of progress on immigration reform and the failure to enact small-donor public financing and reverse Citizens United. History will record that the opposition set out to blockade President Obama at every turn but he was resilient and kept his vision trained on some big and crucial breakthroughs.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I'm an ardent advocate of increasing the minimum wage so working-class people can actually support their families. I support the Raise the Wage Act of 2015 that would raise the wage to $12 an hour. In the Maryland Senate, I built unanimous support for a progressive increase in Maryland's minimum wage over several years. Raising the minimum wage nationally would directly or indirectly raise wages for 35.1 million workers. Raising the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maryland is an imperative this year. This is critical for waitresses and waiters—what other group has to appeal to consumers in order to win a full minimum wage? The federal government should certainly move to require paid sick time and family leave. The lack of a paid sick days policy is bad employment policy and bad public health policy. I support the Healthy Families Act of 2015, which would require all businesses with more than 15 employees to offer up to seven paid sick days a year. We are doing this in Maryland this year! Similarly, no worker should lose his or her job because of the need to care for a family member. The Center for Economic and Policy Research analyzed firms with fewer than fifty employees that voluntarily complied with the Family Medical Leave Act and reported easy implementation and few negative effects, including no evidence that it poses a financial hardship on these firms. These laws are the mark of a civilized society.</p>",
    "q8":"I am a passionate critic of our uncivilized gun laws and the obscene gun violence engulfing America. We need to bring the essential features of the common-sense law we passed in Maryland into being at the federal level. Then–Senator and now Attorney General Brian Frosh and I wrote and steered to passage in 2013 one of the toughest comprehensive gun safety laws in the nation. This session, I'm fighting to compel convicted domestic abusers to surrender all firearms and to pass universal background checks for all types of firearms. In Congress, I will be a relentless advocate for universal background checks, which are a necessity to prevent gun-runners, murderers, and other criminals from obtaining firearms. We also need a Maryland-style fingerprinting system to eliminate the possibility of straw purchasers acquiring firearms for criminals. We should also close the so-called \"Charleston loophole,\" which allows a gun sale to proceed without a completed background check if the check has not been finished within three days. This loophole permitted racist Dylann Roof to purchase a gun before he executed nine people point-blank in a Charleston church even though he had a disqualifying criminal record. I would also work to expand the categories of people barred from purchasing and possessing firearms. Federal law should also prohibit people convicted of domestic abuse from possessing guns. I also would propose that Congress extend federal gun prohibitions to cover partners who have violated permanent or temporary court-ordered domestic violence restraining orders.</p>",
    "q9":"Our redistricting process needs sweeping reform. Elected officials are choosing voters before choose elected officials. This session in Annapolis, I introduced legislation for an interstate compact to establish a single independent redistricting commission— the Potomac Compact for Fair Representation—composed of citizens and experts (no politicians) to design fair districts and proportional voting plans in Maryland and Virginia. Our states make great partners in this effort because we are political opposites—Maryland has a Republican governor and Democratic legislature and Virginia has the reverse. Maryland and Virginia should jump together towards a fairer process and result. We need to explore moving away from single-member districting, which is intertwined inevitably with partisan gerrymandering, towards multi-member districts along with proportional representation voting practices that will empower political minorities and promote broader representation. The aesthetics of district lines are a clue something is profoundly wrong but they are not the constitutional sin itself. Maryland is an oddly-shaped state because of the Chesapeake Bay and we will not be able to draw rectangular districts. The real problem is a 7-1 Democratic-Republican split in the Congressional delegation which does not mirror political preferences in the state; similarly, in Virginia, a state with two Democratic Senators, a Democratic Governor and solid majorities for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, Republicans in the legislature have drawn an indefensible 7-3 Republican-Democratic split. If both parties put skin in the game, we can make progress on a fairer allocation of Congressional seats to reflect the popular will.</p>",
    "q10":"When I first ran for the State Senate, I was repeatedly told that I could not win, and I could never accomplish the bold progressive agenda I was running on: passing marriage equality, abolishing the death penalty, banning military-style assault weapons, restoring voting rights to ex-felons, passing the National Popular Vote plan, enacting a medical marijuana program, and adopting a strong renewable energy plan to dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, not only did I win but, over the last decade, we have passed all of these bills--and I sponsored and also was the floor leader for most of them. So I have seen legislative democracy work and been part of some thrilling breakthrough victories in perhaps the most legislatively productive decade in the history of our state. When Congressman Van Hollen called to tell me he was running for Senate, I knew immediately I wanted to run for his seat because so many of the problems we face today are national and international in scope. We might have one of the best gun safety laws in America but we will continue to have bloody summers like the one we had in Baltimore if the guns just keep flowing in from New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Similarly, we might have among the best environmental laws in America but more than 50 waterways flow into the Bay from out-of-state, and climate change is a civilizational emergency requiring swift and sweeping national and global response. I want to put my demonstrably effective parliamentary skills, political leadership and coalition-building experience and constitutional knowledge to work for a revival of progressive Democratic ideas and organizing in Congress. I have been endorsed by Congressman John Sarbanes, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Sierra Club and the NEA, among dozens of others.</p>"
